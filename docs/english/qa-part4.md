"Concave" and "convex" are two words that describe the shape of an object.

- "Concave" refers to a surface or shape that curves inward, like the inside of a bowl or a cave. It means that the surface is curved inward, towards the center of the object.
- "Convex" refers to a surface or shape that curves outward, like the outside of a sphere or a hill. It means that the surface is curved outward, away from the center of the object.

For example, a concave mirror is one in which the reflecting surface bulges inward, while a convex mirror is one in which the reflecting surface bulges outward.

These two words are also used in geometry and mathematics, in which they are used to describe the properties of certain shapes and curves.

It's also important to note that "concave" and "convex" are antonyms, meaning they have opposite meanings.
