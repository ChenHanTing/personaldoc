### I see a little bit of clutter here

"Clutter" and "declutter" are terms often used in the context of organizing and managing physical spaces, but they can also apply to non-physical contexts like digital environments or even one's mind.

1. **Clutter**: This refers to a collection of things lying around in an untidy or disorganized state. It can be physical items, like a pile of papers, books, clothes, or any other objects that are scattered or stacked in a disorganized manner. Clutter can also be non-physical, like having too many unorganized thoughts, tasks, or digital files.

2. **Declutter**: This is the process of removing unnecessary items from an untidy or overcrowded space. To declutter means to organize and prioritize, getting rid of excess items or organizing them in a way that makes the space more orderly and functional. This term, too, can apply to both physical and non-physical contexts. For example, decluttering your home might involve sorting through belongings and discarding or donating those you no longer need or use, while decluttering your mind might involve practices like meditation or journaling to organize and process your thoughts.

將心裡面所想的說出來

To "vocalize the emotions" means to express one's feelings through words. It involves communicating emotions, such as happiness, sadness, frustration, or excitement, verbally to others. This can be an important part of emotional intelligence and interpersonal communication, as it helps in sharing one's internal state, fostering understanding and empathy in relationships or group dynamics.

For example, instead of just feeling anxious and keeping it to oneself, vocalizing it would be saying, "I feel really anxious about this upcoming meeting."

This practice can lead to better emotional support and connection with others, as it allows people to understand and respond to your feelings more effectively.

### Projecting opinions

"Projecting opinions" usually refers to the act of imposing one's own beliefs, feelings, or biases onto others or onto a situation. It can mean that a person is assuming others share their opinions or that they're interpreting events through their own subjective lens. This can lead to misunderstandings or conflicts, especially if the projected opinions are not shared or welcomed by others.

For example, if someone is unhappy and they assume everyone else around them is also unhappy, they are projecting their feelings onto others.

In all these scenarios, the key aspect of projection is the assumption that others share the same views, feelings, or experiences, which is not always the case. This can lead to misunderstandings and sometimes conflicts, as it doesn't take into account the individuality and diversity of perspectives among people.

1. **Strong Inkling**: This phrase suggests a more intuitive or gut feeling about something that might not be based on concrete evidence. An inkling is like a hint or a suspicion.

### Crossover

**Why crossover has one meaning which is mate or intercourse, and another one is overlap?**

The word "crossover" has multiple meanings, which can vary significantly based on the context in which it is used. The versatility of this term arises from its ability to describe different types of intersections or combinations across various fields. Let's break down the two meanings you mentioned:

1. **Biological Context (Mate or Intercourse)**: In biology, "crossover" refers to a process that occurs during meiosis, a type of cell division that leads to the formation of gametes (sperm and egg cells). During crossover, there is an exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes. This exchange increases genetic diversity in the offspring, as it combines the genetic material from both parents. In a broader and more metaphorical sense, "crossover" can be used to describe mating or intercourse, particularly when emphasizing the genetic exchange aspect.

2. **General Context (Overlap)**: More generally, "crossover" is used to describe a situation where two or more things intersect or overlap. This can be used in various contexts, such as in music, television, culture, and more. For example, a "crossover" artist in music might blend elements of different genres. In television, a "crossover" episode involves characters from one show appearing in another show, creating an overlap between the two separate narratives.

The reason why a single word like "crossover" can have such diverse meanings is due to the evolution of language and the tendency for words to develop new meanings based on how they are used in different contexts. It's a common linguistic phenomenon where a word's meaning expands or shifts over time, often retaining its original sense but also gaining new ones relevant to different fields or perspectives.

### Tom bypassed what I mentioned

The phrase "Tom bypassed what I mentioned" means that Tom either ignored, avoided, or chose not to address or consider the information, suggestions, or topics that you had mentioned earlier. This could imply that Tom intentionally disregarded your comments, or simply moved past them without giving them due attention or response. The context in which this phrase is used would determine whether Tom's action was due to oversight, disagreement, irrelevance, or some other reason.
