### Do you know what is the term of a duck deem whoever as a mother with its first glance

The term you are likely referring to is "imprinting," which is a form of learning that occurs in some animals, including ducks. Imprinting is a process by which an animal develops a strong attachment to a particular individual or object during a critical period early in its life. In the case of ducks, this often involves the mother duck "imprinting" on her ducklings, meaning that the ducklings develop a strong attachment to her and follow her closely.

There is also a phenomenon called "filial imprinting," in which an animal, such as a duckling, develops a strong attachment to the first moving object it sees after hatching. This can result in the animal treating that object, such as a human, as if it were its mother.

It's important to note that imprinting is a natural and important part of the development of many animals, and it can have a significant impact on their behavior and social interactions. However, it is not something that can be deliberately induced or controlled by humans.

These spikes can occur due to a variety of factors, such as a sudden increase in website traffic, a surge in customer orders or inquiries, or unexpected demand for a specific product or service. Such spikes can put a strain on the infrastructure and resources of a company, potentially leading to slower response times, system failures, or other issues that could negatively impact the customer experience. The phrase "automatically react to spikes in demand with scalable infrastructure" suggests that a company has a system in place that can automatically detect and respond to these spikes by scaling up its infrastructure, such as adding more servers or increasing network bandwidth, to handle the increased demand in a timely and efficient manner.

**I remember I first learnt this word from biology**

In biology, "spike" can have different meanings depending on the context. Here are a few examples:

1. In the context of viruses, a "spike" is a structure on the surface of the virus that helps it attach to and enter host cells. For example, the spike protein on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is what allows it to enter human cells and cause COVID-19.
2. In neuroscience, a "spike" refers to a brief electrical signal or action potential that occurs in individual neurons. These spikes are the primary means by which neurons communicate with one another in the brain.
3. In genetics, a "spike-in" is a type of experimental control used to validate the accuracy of a genomic assay or sequencing technique. A spike-in involves adding a known amount of DNA or RNA to a sample at a specific stage of the experiment to determine whether the assay accurately detects and quantifies the added material.

These are just a few examples of how "spike" can be used in a biological context. The term is quite versatile and can have different meanings depending on the specific field of study or research.
