   - **Another security vendor**: Refers to another company that provides similar networking and security solutions, but not specifically named.
   - **Switches and APs**: Refers to networking equipment for directing traffic (switches) and providing wireless connections (access points).

9. **"They downplay how many features a campus needs"**:
   - **Downplay**: Implies that the vendor is not giving enough attention to, or is underestimating, the importance of certain features.
   - **How many features a campus needs**: Refers to the functionalities necessary for a large-scale network (such as a university campus) to operate efficiently.

10. **"Cisco is the easy punching bag here"**:
    - **Punching bag**: This is a metaphor indicating that Cisco is often criticized, perhaps unfairly or frequently.
    - **Easy**: Suggests that it's common or convenient for people to complain about Cisco, but it might not always be warranted.

11. **"Going from Cisco wireless to any other type wireless got myself is difficult"**:
    - **Going from Cisco wireless**: Refers to transitioning from using Cisco's wireless equipment.
    - **Any other type wireless**: Indicates a generalization about other brands of wireless devices.
    - **Difficult**: Suggests that Cisco wireless is so robust or familiar that switching to another brand feels challenging or less efficient.

**Summary of Word Analysis:**

- **Simplicity and stability** are praised when referring to ION, implying that people appreciate products that are easy to use and reliable.
- **FortiSwitch/FortiAPs** receive negative feedback, with trials being described as **miserable** and **lacking stability and features**.
- There is an emphasis on how **features** and **reliability** are critical for larger environments like campuses, and some vendors may **downplay** this.
- **Cisco** is described as an industry leader but also a frequent target of criticism (referred to as a **punching bag**), which suggests mixed opinions about its dominance in the networking field. However, the difficulty of switching from Cisco indicates its superior performance or familiarity.



From the conversation, it seems that **Cisco** is being indirectly positioned as a reliable and well-established player in the networking field. While there are mentions of issues with other brands like Fortinet, SonicWall, and others, Cisco is referred to as the "easy punching bag," implying that it is often criticized but may still outperform its competitors in certain aspects, particularly in reliability and feature set. 

This conversation overall reflects dissatisfaction with newer or less established vendors, while Cisco's products are implied to perform better, even though they're often criticized in the industry.

One participant even notes the difficulty in moving from Cisco wireless to other types of wireless setups, which suggests that Cisco’s products might be more robust or user-friendly, making transitions to other vendors challenging. While the conversation includes some criticism, it highlights that Cisco remains a benchmark for comparison in networking solutions.

The person in this comment is defending **FortiSwitch** and **FortiAP** against criticism, arguing that just because someone may have had a poor experience with these products, it doesn't mean they are terrible. They make a few key points:

1. **Questioning the Criticism**: 
   - They ask what specifically is wrong with FortiSwitch or FortiAP, implying that the original critique may be subjective and not based on actual technical shortcomings. 
   - They suggest that perhaps the user finds Aruba more suitable for their needs, but that doesn't mean FortiSwitch or FortiAP are inherently bad.

2. **Comfort Level vs. Product Suitability**:
   - The commenter points out that individual comfort levels with certain brands or products might influence one's opinion.
   - They note that just because a product doesn't meet someone's specific needs, that doesn’t make it a bad product overall. It could simply be that Fortinet's solution wasn’t suited to the user's particular setup or preferences.

3. **Interoperability**:
   - The commenter stresses that interoperability between vendors is generally not a major issue in networking. They highlight the work of standards organizations like **IETF** and **IEEE**, which develop protocols to ensure that devices from different vendors can work together.
   - This suggests that vendor incompatibility is less likely to be the source of the original user's dissatisfaction.

4. **Personal Experience**:
   - The commenter shares their personal experience, saying they have worked with many deployments that included FortiGate, and those deployments went smoothly. This serves as evidence that the issue might not be with the product itself but with how it was used or implemented in the original user's case.

The commenter provides a more nuanced perspective, suggesting that user preference or specific needs might have influenced the negative view of FortiSwitch and FortiAP. They argue that these products work fine in many deployments and emphasize that interoperability across vendors is generally well-handled, making technical issues less likely.

**comfort level** in this context refers to how familiar or at ease a person feels with a particular product, system, or technology. It's often based on experience, habits, and preferences. When someone has worked with a specific product for a long time, they might feel more comfortable using it, even if another product could technically meet their needs just as well (or even better). This can lead to a personal preference for familiar tools, rather than objective performance differences.

So, yes, it’s a bit personal. Comfort level isn't necessarily about the product’s technical merit—it’s more about the user's familiarity, ease of use, and previous experience with similar technologies. When someone feels comfortable with a product, they can often work faster and with less frustration. Conversely, even a good product might seem "difficult" if it’s new or unfamiliar.
