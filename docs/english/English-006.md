The mention of "due to the large number of admissions" suggests that there might have been a competitive process or a significant interest in the opportunity, indicating that the admission is a noteworthy accomplishment.

   - "You're visiting Aunt Clara tomorrow, right? Please, give my regards to her."

### The data docked from Excel to our CMS

Saying "the data docked from Excel to our CMS" is not a common or standard usage of the term "docked." While "docked" is often used in the context of boats or spacecraft connecting to a physical structure or port, it's not typically used in the context of data transfer between software applications like Excel and a Content Management System (CMS).

A more appropriate way to describe the action of transferring data from Excel to a CMS would be to say "the data was imported from Excel to our CMS" or "the data was transferred from Excel to our CMS." These phrases more accurately convey the process of moving data between software systems.

**Using ship is also not appropriate**

Using "ship" in the context of data transfer from Excel to a CMS is not a common or standard terminology either. It's better to stick with more commonly used terms like "import" or "transfer."

### Aroma

"Aroma" refers to a distinctive, pervasive, and usually pleasant or savory smell, such as the aroma of freshly-baked bread. It can also describe the specific odor of wine imparted by the grapes it's made from. Additionally, "aroma" can signify a distinctive quality or atmosphere, metaphorically referred to as the flavor of an experience

### 眼科、皮膚科、眼科醫生、皮膚科醫生

眼科 in English is "Ophthalmology," which is the branch of medicine dealing with the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases of the eye and visual system.

### 跟你預告、打預防針

To express the concepts of "跟你預告" (informing you in advance) and "打預防針" (giving a heads-up as a precaution) in English, you can use phrases such as:

1. **For "跟你預告"**: 
   - "Letting you know in advance..."
   - "I want to inform you beforehand..."
   - "Giving you a heads-up..."

2. **For "打預防針"**:
   - "Giving you a heads-up to prepare you..."
   - "Just to forewarn you..."
   - "I'm giving you a preemptive warning..."

Both expressions are used to alert someone about something before it happens, either to prepare them, prevent misunderstanding, or mitigate potential issues. "打預防針" literally translates to "giving a preventive shot," implying taking precautionary measures, and in English, "giving a heads-up" or "forewarning" captures this preventive or preparatory intent.

### I get url is malformed becuase only use absolute urls

我得到的URL格式不正确，因为只使用了绝对URL。 

### 工作型態、工作類型

The Chinese terms "工作型態" and "工作類型" can both be translated into English, but they have slightly different nuances:

- "工作型態" translates to "work style" or "work pattern." It refers to the manner or approach in which work is conducted, including aspects like work environment, work hours (such as traditional 9-to-5, shift work, or flexible scheduling), and whether the work is remote, in-office, or hybrid.

- "工作類型" translates to "type of work" or "job type." This term is more about categorizing work based on the nature of the job itself, such as full-time, part-time, contract, freelance, or the sector it belongs to (e.g., tech, healthcare, education).

Both terms are used to discuss and classify various aspects of employment but from slightly different perspectives.

### I was nearly exhausted to the point of breaking down

"I was nearly exhausted to the point of breaking down" means that the person was extremely tired, both physically and possibly mentally, to a level where they felt they could no longer continue or were on the verge of a collapse. This expression conveys a sense of intense fatigue that impacts one's ability to function normally.

### One person do main job and another do sidekiq

The phrase you've provided suggests a division of labor or tasks between two individuals, where one person handles the primary or main job, and another person takes care of "sidekiq." In this context, "sidekiq" likely refers to secondary or supportive tasks, but it's worth noting that Sidekiq is also the name of a background processing tool for Ruby programming language, used to handle asynchronous jobs. If your intention was to describe a workplace or project scenario, the sentence could be rephrased for clarity as follows:

"One person is responsible for the main task, while another handles the auxiliary tasks or Sidekiq jobs, depending on the context."

This rephrasing clarifies the division of roles without assuming specific knowledge about Sidekiq, allowing the sentence to be understood in both a general labor division context and a specific programming or technical project context.

**Batman and Robin** 

The phrase "one person does the main job and another does sidekick" can metaphorically relate to Batman and Robin in the context of a partnership where there is a clear lead and support dynamic. Batman and Robin are a classic example of a superhero team where Batman takes the lead role, handling the primary responsibilities and making critical decisions, while Robin supports Batman, assists in various tasks, and takes on secondary objectives. 

In the original context you provided, "sidekiq" (with a 'q') refers to a background processing framework for Ruby, which is unrelated to superhero dynamics. However, if we adjust the wording to "sidekick," it aligns with the Batman and Robin analogy, highlighting a partnership where roles are divided between a primary actor and a supportive ally. This analogy is often used to describe situations in work or projects where tasks are distributed between team members with one taking a leading role and the other providing necessary support to achieve a common goal.

### Customer Service Support

If you're referring to an abbreviation that includes "customer service," CSS in that context could stand for "Customer Service Specialist," "Customer Service Support," or any similar variation where the last word begins with "S" and relates to a role or function within customer service. Without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact term you're looking for.

### PUA

PUA stands for "Pickup Artist." It refers to a person, usually a man, who uses certain techniques and tactics purported to teach them how to attract and seduce potential romantic or sexual partners. The PUA community has developed its own jargon and methodologies, which they share through books, seminars, online forums, and workshops.

The PUA movement has been controversial, with critics arguing that many of the techniques promote manipulative and disrespectful behavior towards women. Proponents of the movement often claim they are simply teaching social skills and confidence-building strategies to help men improve their romantic or sexual interactions with women.

### 有根據，不是空穴來風的

The English phrase for "有根據，不是空穴來風的" is "based on solid evidence, not unfounded or without basis." This means that the information or claim is supported by concrete evidence or facts, rather than being speculative or based on rumors.

### go-to meaning of sideways

Yes, "sideways" is most commonly used as an adverb in English. It describes the manner in which something moves, is positioned, or is oriented, meaning moving, facing, or directed to the side, rather than forwards or backwards. For example:

- "The car skidded sideways across the road."
- "She glanced sideways at him."
- "The drawer opens sideways."

In these sentences, "sideways" describes the direction of movement or orientation, indicating a lateral or side-to-side action.

### Go-to and go-to phrase

"Go-to" is an adjective used to describe a preferred or most commonly chosen option among several. It signifies something or someone that you rely on regularly or turn to when you need a solution or result. For example, a "go-to person" is someone you frequently rely on for help or advice, and a "go-to recipe" is a tried-and-true dish you make often because it's easy and delicious.

A "go-to phrase," specifically, is a frequently used expression or sentence that a person regularly employs in conversation or writing. It's a default set of words someone uses often, either because it effectively communicates their thoughts or feelings, or simply out of habit. These phrases can serve various purposes, such as breaking the ice in conversations, filling pauses, or emphasizing a point.

### 錄取了

The Chinese phrase "錄取了" translates to "admitted" or "accepted" in English. It is commonly used to indicate that someone has been accepted or admitted into an institution, such as a university, or for a job position. For example, "He was admitted to the university" or "She was accepted for the job."

### in the event of…

"In the event of..." is a phrase used to introduce a conditional statement, specifying actions to be taken or conditions to be met if a particular scenario occurs. It is often used in formal, instructional, or planning contexts to prepare for potential situations. Here’s how to use it effectively:

1. **Identify the Scenario or Condition**: Begin by clearly stating the specific scenario or condition that might trigger the need for a response or action. This is what follows "in the event of..."

2. **Specify the Response or Action**: After stating the scenario, detail the response, action, or procedure that should be followed in response to that scenario. This part usually comes after a comma or in the next sentence.

3. **Be Clear and Precise**: The scenario and response should be described clearly and concisely to avoid any ambiguity. This is particularly important in emergency procedures, legal documents, and formal plans where clarity is crucial.

### Examples:

- **Emergency Procedures**: "In the event of a fire, all employees should exit the building through the nearest emergency exit."
  
- **Legal Documents**: "In the event of the borrower's default, the lender may seek full repayment of the outstanding loan amount immediately."
  
- **Project Planning**: "In the event of project delays, the team will prioritize tasks according to the revised project timeline."
  
- **Health and Safety**: "In the event of an earthquake, drop to the ground, take cover under a sturdy piece of furniture, and hold on until the shaking stops."

- **Technical Troubleshooting**: "In the event of a system failure, please restart your device and attempt to reconnect."

Using "in the event of..." prepares the audience for potential scenarios and clearly instructs them on the appropriate response or action to take, enhancing readiness and reducing uncertainty. 加強準備以及減少不確定性

### Own up to

"Own up to" is a phrase used to describe the act of taking responsibility or admitting to one's actions, mistakes, or shortcomings（承認自己的行爲、錯误或不足之處。）. It involves acknowledging something that one might prefer to deny or hide, especially when that something is unfavorable or wrong. This phrase emphasizes honesty and accountability, suggesting that the individual is willing to accept the consequences of their actions. It's often used in contexts where moral integrity, personal growth, or the resolution of a conflict is involved.

Examples:

1. **Mistakes or Wrongdoings**: "He decided to own up to his mistake and apologized for the oversight."
   
2. **Personal Feelings or Thoughts**: "After months of denial, she finally owned up to her feelings for him."
   
3. **Responsibilities**: "It's time to own up to our responsibilities towards the environment and take action."
   
4. **Failures or Shortcomings**: "The company needs to own up to its failures in customer service and improve."

Using "own up to" indicates a willingness to face the truth and deal with the repercussions, which is often seen as a commendable and mature approach to handling difficult situations.

### Handoff

最近因為我的女朋友回台南探望她的父親，平時由她照顧的貓咪就變成了我的責任。在這期間，我學會了許多照顧貓咪的技巧，包括如何給貓咪注射、如何進行皮下打針，以及如何安排藥物服用時間，比如每隔一小時要給貓咪服用特定的西藥或中藥等。當我的女朋友還在時，我經常忙於自己的事情，幾乎不參與照顧貓咪。但在她不在的時候，我真的只能依靠自己。

她剛離開那天，我因為忘記了很多操作方法，所以經常透過視訊向她求助。那天結束時，我累得幾乎要崩潰。但到了第二天和第三天，雖然還有一些事情不太懂，但因為身邊沒有人可以幫忙，我從感到無助到最後自己找出餵食方法。這個過程讓我領悟到，當自己必須獨立面對問題時，終會找到解決的辦法。

我認為我的離職不會讓團隊減少一人。多年來，我一直是團隊的主力，而你們扮演團隊的助手。目前，hyte.com的開發已經接近完成，但客服和會計部門還有許多事務需要我們協作解決。由於HYTE和iBUYPOWER Portal之間存在不一致，我們還需要處理Rex遇到的問題。當前，我們仍有許多事情可以做。如果Wei和Daniel未來能夠成為團隊的雙主力，那麼新成員加入時也能更快熟悉工作。我們是一個充滿活力的團隊，相信未來會更加美好。

Recently, because my girlfriend went back to Tainan to visit her father, the responsibility of caring for the cat, which she usually takes care of, has fallen to me. During this period, I learned many skills for taking care of the cat, including how to inject medication, how to administer subcutaneous injections, and how to schedule medication times, such as administering specific Western or Chinese medicines every hour. When my girlfriend was here, I was often busy with my own things and hardly involved in caring for the cat. But in her absence, I really had to rely on myself.

The day she left, I often had to video call her for help because I had forgotten many of the procedures. By the end of that day, I was nearly exhausted to the point of breaking down. However, by the second and third days, although there were still some things I didn't quite understand, because there was no one around to help, I went from feeling helpless to figuring out feeding methods on my own. This process made me realize that when one must face a problem alone, one will eventually find a solution.

I believe my departure will not leave the team one person short. For years, I have been the main force of the team, while you have played the role of assistants. Currently, the development of hyte.com is nearing completion, but there are still many tasks in customer service and accounting departments that require our collaboration to resolve. Due to inconsistencies between HYTE and iBUYPOWER Portal, we also need to address the problems Rex is encountering. There are still many things we can do at the moment. If Wei and Daniel can become the main forces ❌ of the team in the future, then new members joining the team can also get up to speed faster. We are a vibrant team, and I believe the future will be even better.

**Handoff** refers to the process of transferring responsibility, control, or information from one person or system to another. It's commonly used in various contexts, including telecommunications, healthcare, and project management, to describe the act of passing something along to another party.

For example:

- In healthcare, a "handoff" might refer to the process where one nurse or doctor passes patient information to another at the end of their shift.
- In software development or project management, a "handoff" can describe the process of transferring completed work or responsibilities from one team to another, such as from the development team to the quality assurance team.

### 主力（工作上）

In the context of describing someone or something that plays a pivotal role in a work environment or any other context, using "main force" might not convey the intended meaning accurately in English. The term "main force" is more commonly associated with physical force or military strength. Instead, there are other terms and phrases that are more suitable and commonly used to describe playing a pivotal or central role:

- **Key player**
- **Major contributor**
- **Central figure**
- **Pivotal role**
- **Crucial part**
- **Core member**
- **Vital component**

For example, if you want to describe someone who is instrumental in the success of a project, you could say, "She is a key player in our team's success," or "He plays a pivotal role in our project's development."

These alternatives better capture the essence of someone or something being critically important or indispensable in a non-physical context, such as in a workplace, project, or organization.

### `administer = give` in a more general sense?

In a medical or healthcare context, "to administer" a medication means to give or apply it to a patient. This term is more formal and is commonly used by healthcare professionals to describe the process of providing drugs, vaccines, or treatments to individuals. "Administer" can refer to various methods of delivering medication, including but not limited to oral (by mouth), intravenous (into a vein), intramuscular (into a muscle), subcutaneous (under the skin), topical (applied to the skin), or inhalation (breathed into the lungs) routes.

While "give" can be used interchangeably with "administer" in everyday language and still be understood, "administer" is more specific to the deliberate, controlled process of providing treatments according to medical guidelines and practices.

Essentially, it suggests that the speaker finds the topic or question uninteresting or irritating and prefers that the person addressing them seeks out someone else who might be more receptive or patient. This use of "bore" is informal and can be seen as dismissive or impolite, depending on the context and tone in which it is used.

The terms "whining" and "trying" refer to distinctly different behaviors or actions:

1. **Whining**:
   - **Definition**: Whining is the act of complaining in an annoying, crying, or distressed manner, often about something relatively minor. It is characterized by a high-pitched, plaintive tone of voice and implies a lack of maturity or resilience in dealing with discomfort or dissatisfaction.
   - **Context**: Whining is often associated with children, though adults can whine too. It's generally viewed negatively because it suggests an inability to cope constructively with challenges or disappointments.
   - **Example**: Someone might whine about having to do a small household chore, expressing their displeasure in a way that is disproportionate to the task's difficulty.

2. **Trying**:
   - **Definition**: Trying can have two main meanings, depending on the context. The first is the effort or attempt to do something, indicating an action undertaken with the intention of accomplishing a task or goal. The second meaning refers to a situation, task, or experience that is difficult or frustrating, testing one's patience or endurance.
   - **Context**: When used to describe effort, trying suggests a positive action of attempting to overcome challenges or achieve objectives. As an adjective describing situations, it denotes difficulty but doesn't inherently imply a negative reaction; rather, it acknowledges the challenge.
   - **Example (Effort)**: She is trying to learn a new language, dedicating time each day to practice and study.
   - **Example (Difficult Situation)**: The long recovery period after the surgery was a trying time for him, but he remained optimistic.

### Deploying to Two Vercel Projects with a Shared GitHub Repository Across Different Branches

The word "across" is used in the revised title to clarify that the deployment process involves using different branches of the same GitHub repository for two separate Vercel projects. It indicates that the deployments span or cover different branches, highlighting the distinction and separation within the same repository that's being utilized for multiple environments or purposes.
