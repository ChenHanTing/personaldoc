### I don't know if that means you would have to create a new SKU ID per se, or if you could maybe repurpose this.

The phrase "repurpose this" and the term "per se" have specific meanings:

### Repurpose This

To "repurpose" something means to take an object, system, or material that was originally intended for one use and adapt it for a different use. In the context of your sentence, suggesting that something could be "repurposed" implies taking an existing item, process, or system and finding a new use for it, rather than creating something entirely new from scratch. This approach is often considered in various fields, including business, technology, and environmental sustainability, to maximize resources and efficiency.

### Per Se

- I don't know if it needs a ticket per se, because if it's something that is, this is more process, right?

"Per se" is a Latin phrase that has been adopted into English, meaning "by itself" or "in itself." When used in a sentence, it indicates that you are referring to something in its most basic or intrinsic nature. The phrase often serves to narrow down a statement to a specific idea or element, suggesting that something is true on its own, without considering anything else.

In your sentence, "I don't know if that means you would have to create a new SKU ID per se" suggests uncertainty about whether a new Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) ID needs to be created strictly on its own terms or if there is flexibility in the approach, possibly by modifying or repurposing an existing SKU for the new purpose.

The inclusion of "per se" here implies that while creating a new SKU ID might be one way to address the situation, it's not necessarily the only approach, and there might be alternatives worth considering, such as repurposing an existing SKU.

### This essentially occurs when an item is out of stock, and then the inventory is subsequently replenished

is subsequently replenished - 之後被補充了

I interpreted and clarified that you might be discussing the process of restocking items that have gone out of stock.

### Thanks for thanks for cranking this out so fast.

### Statements

- I I I think you might have I think you fixed it like immediately right after we talked about it.

- Yeah, we marked as done.

- I have a feeling half of these tickets in backlog I'll probably obsolete by now

- Me, Jeff, just so we can sign off on it and then we could and I I guess they would have to put the two weeks in which means what is it first week of April, 2 weeks I'm hoping by end of April that they can join.

- See this is this is prime example. Daniel is notorious for this.

- So yeah, I think I think the better way to approach this is, yeah, we need to sit down and just look at the whole preorder workflow and see.

- **continue the trend** we've been having where we're just adding stuff to Sprint 15 instead of reconsidering what we wanna prioritize and see if it's reasonable within Sprint, a single Sprint.

- And people actually prefer to have to be informed in multiple different facets for like different platforms, cuz I would gladly be want to be informed via Twitter anywhere that I can and that I'm exposed to the brand is exposed to or I'm exposed to the brand I would like to see an update when so like whether it's email, discord, Reddit, wherever, the more places we can display that there's a delay or communicate with customers the better.

- So that's why that's why I say I don't think this is something we could just jump right into it.

- You know the whole keeping people in the loop in terms of their order status, I think that could be done in the my account page rather than email.

- OK, so I'm going to move this to Sprint 15 as well.

  Alright, complete this \*\*\*\*.

  Goodbye urgent requests.

  This \*\*\*\* never works.

  And so alright, so ...

- Push it tonight and then I'll play around with it tomorrow and then let's say if there's some bugs. Daniel, would you be able to?

- But not, but probably not for you John and Daniel, because I know, John, you've been creating tickets and Daniel's been kind of just working off of those, but it's more so like Han and and way cause because they they're they're they're just lazy and focus on on those two big tasks.

- But right now this is my only my only lead (direction)

- Microsoft Azure is catching up at a rapid rate, right?

- it just uses meaning to update you on things and then I'll I'll, I'll just try to figure out this consignment stuff myself.

- This task will accomplish something going SEO right and improve our indexing in some way.

- My hierarchy? Yeah, a class at my classification.

- But yeah, that's aside from the point.

  $17500 + bonus + stock

- Like umm like I know you have no problem with over engineering. You under engineer sometimes.

- Like if you need to make the change to make it more scalable, is it easy?

- create a proposal first, a documentation. Alright.

- We can point it out, right, and we can also help each other understand like which parts will need to be scaled immediately and which parts we can just leave alone.

- If it's not easily scalable in the future and example of something that's not scalable in the like immediately is, let's go back to teams.

- Alright, so the point is like, yeah, for any big projects for any big projects must have a proposal.

- And he's really he's a really good developer and and he also used to work at a big corporation (company) too

- Yeah, so now there's a historical data and that's a lot and that's a lot easier.

- Yeah, it could be a little paranoid.

- I'll play around with it too, and then we'll we'll meet up again to talk about our progress.

- Like I think planning or sometimes like sometimes I make good pull requests, it looks like very little code but a lot of thought goes into that very little code because sometimes it's not about more code, it's more about you put this code has affected anything else I have to cover my bases, make sure even this little code doesn't affect other things, right?

- Uh or engineering philosophy is more like quality and like you know, not necessarily spewing out code.

- if you started off with this, then you have to scale right away.

- So like even like simple changes like that, a lot of thought goes into it and like, research to see like, OK, what is the best practice even though it's like 1 simple change.

- Ohh yeah, we wanna understand we wanna be able to follow.

- But I don't want to accidentally overlook anything, right?

- I think the new shift is from quality to right over quantity now of our project.

- So yeah, this is this is really this is really actually just the the main point here, right is just we'll make it as simple as possible and we'll only only things that need to be scaled immediately will need to be scaled immediately.

- Otherwise you can go down a deep rabbit hole of over engineering every aspect of the project.

-

- Otherwise you can go down a deep rabbit hole of over engineering every aspect of the project.

-

-

- Otherwise you can go down a deep rabbit hole of over engineering every aspect of the project.

-

- That's why you needed to have a proposal documentation and it doesn't even necessarily have to be us as cause you didn't.

- I would say personalization, while personally supposed to follow under for account, just anything that makes it more unique, the website more unique to the individual.

- Yeah, there might be some tasks that I need help with Daniel to complete for Rex to uh work off of, but for the most part it's it's a Rex Straub.

- Wait, so you're saying you can still put, like, some randomized email like John at ABC DEFGA t.com and it still works?

- I gotta say, it's like I said, dude, there's a lot of dupes in here.

- It's weird, it doesn't let you save your birthday or and if it does, it deducts one day from the birthday.

  So if your birthday was like September 30th, it would save as September 29th, yeah.

- So if you have, if you have that spreadsheet, just go into that spreadsheet, update the price for Y60Y60 refurbish and the Y-40 every instance of it, and then we upload it and we should be good

- So like on Tik T.O.K or like Instagram store front, you have to create a product feed in order to list your products and that that pulls the data from the link that Bigcommerce generates that has all those product that product information descriptions and then basically just pops it up on the platform.

- We need to work on this because what I'm hearing is that if we continue to have this issue, they're gonna kick us out from the site, which is not good, so.

- 00 in front
  00 in front of the UPC

- They specifically wanted us to change this to Taipei.
  Because they didn't want it to say Taiwan, I guess there's there's beef or something.

- Gonna be more maintenance

- It's weird that it persisted data that.

- Basically, before we could push it live otherwise it's I have a good feeling that it's just gonna replace what's in production with sanity.

- So it's not like, you know, my my biggest concern is if they were interviewing, they get another offer, then we're kind of like back to square one, which I do not want to do again.

- Because their ultimate goal is to make sure customers are aware of when their items gonna be shipped, right?

3. **Biological Context**: In its most literal sense, a vein is a type of blood vessel that carries blood towards the heart. Unlike arteries, which carry blood away from the heart, veins are part of the circulatory system that returns deoxygenated blood back to the heart to be re-oxygenated.
4. But the basically the purpose of this is to keep customers informed in terms of their preorder purchase, right?

### working off

But not, but probably not for you John and Daniel, because I know, John, you've been creating tickets and Daniel's been kind of just working off of those, but it's more so like Han and and way cause because they they're they're they're just lazy and focus on on those two big tasks.

The phrase "working off" in the context you've provided means that Daniel has been using the tickets created by John as a basis or starting point for his work. It implies that Daniel's tasks, activities, or contributions are directly related to, or dependent upon, the tickets John has generated.

### xxx, where yyy

- I think Notion also has a AI feature too, where you could write stuff for you.
- I'm trying to think because because we we talked about this too where where I thought it should be my account instead of account because my account to me is more clear that this is anything that has to do with a user's account, right?

### Distinct can be a verb

"Distinct" can indeed be used as a verb, typically meaning to make something clearly noticeable or clearly separate from others. For example:

### Meeting Apr 13

- When John comes to us and say that this customer is having an issue with his order, you know?
- This customer's order is somehow either lost the status is wrong or whatever, right and he always, you know, include an order number
- Basically right one user, but it so yeah, so it's very specific to individual uh order, right, not in a broad sense where like for example when when John comes to us and say every person who use PayPal to check out is having issue, their status is automatically changing to cancel right.
- I think we might be it's running in circles right here cause.
- Transactional issues
  So that means it would be issues related to that user experience checking out and then what Han is mentioning is like post transactional issues that can come up too right or like post transactional stuff that we can improve on
- If we're not, if we're not gonna expect other members to label their own issue, then we have to be mindful and literally check every day in JIRA to see what new issues are coming in and then labeling it accordingly.
- Yeah, but yeah, we'll we'll always scan the cause.
- For now, we're just calling it ongoing, right, but essentially some some tests don't fit `within a two week span`, right?
- We just wanna weigh just tracking on ongoing projects, right, and being able to like be able to manage it be like ohh hey, you know we were spending `a couple of spins` and how how's it going right or how long, how long we've been working on this.
- Well, sudden he got thrown in these two new tasks to do right, so that since those are urgent tasks, we will then throw those into the current Sprint too.
- So if we overload the Sprint with too many tickets and then we have all these new incoming tickets that we need to address, it just powers up like how we have it right now, like our spins are crazy. Dude.
- You know, you look at every Sprint we have, it's like it's it's a whole laundry list of of tickets which which to me is impressive.
- So so hard to answer your question when we have these incoming tickets during a Sprint.
- It really depends on the urgency, so if it's something that's urgent, then yes, we need to, we need to put it in the current Sprint, but if it's something that is not urgent, then we put in the backlog and we let them know that OK, you know what is then this is when we ask the question to them, what's the priority of this, you know, like and they'll probably say ohh, you know it's not urgent, but I need it soon, right?
- Hey, by the way, this one has been pushed off even though it wasn't necessarily a a big project, right? OK.
- So so anytime you, you know, a ticket in a Sprint that's gonna move on to another ticket, always apply a story point.
- OK, I have something with my family.
- And then over time, you'll just, you know, it will just kind of become natural to you.
- So also remember this this is a shared board, so these these these status also needs to like like some some of the design stuff probably don't apply to to development and vice versa.

### Pedophile

All parents want to protect their children from predators, but how do you keep your kids safe when you don't know how to spot one? Anyone can be a child molester, so identifying one can be difficult — especially because most child molesters are initially trusted by the children they abuse. Read on to learn which behaviors and traits are red flags, what situations to avoid, and how to deter child molesters from targeting your child.

Someone who is a pedophile is not always a child molester, and many one-off child molesters are not attracted to children. A pedophile may not sexually abuse children themselves but may view child pornography, which is also a severe criminal offence and helps to maintain the cycle of child sexual abuse. An adult who is good at interacting and understanding children is **not** a pedophile by default. **Wrongly accusing someone of child molestation or pedophilia can cause severe depressions and social anxieties, and falls under false allegation of sexual abuse, a form of slander**
