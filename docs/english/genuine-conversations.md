The loop being referred to in that paragraph is a metaphorical one. It means that you are not part of a particular group or community and therefore you are not up to date with the latest information or developments.

### Computer spot

I didn't notice your big tongue .. hahaha I noticed lots of clothes hanging behind your computer spot

"Computer spot" in this context is likely referring to the physical location where the person's computer is located. It could be a desk or table where they have set up their computer equipment. "Lots of clothes hanging behind your computer spot" could mean that there are clothes hanging on a rack or hangers in the area where their computer is located, possibly indicating that it's a multi-purpose space or that they have limited room for storage.

### dauntless

I also want to practice to be more shameless than ever

let's just use "to be more confident or dauntless than ever"

"dauntless" is an adjective that describes someone who is fearless, brave, or courageous in the face of difficulty, danger, or adversity. To be dauntless means to be undaunted or not easily intimidated by challenges or obstacles.

Someone who is dauntless may still feel fear, but they do not let that fear control their actions. Instead, they are able to face their fears and move forward with confidence and determination.

For example, a soldier who rushes into battle without hesitation can be described as dauntless. Similarly, someone who stands up to a bully despite feeling scared can also be said to be dauntless.

"Dauntless" and "shameless" are two different adjectives with distinct meanings.

"Dauntless" describes someone who is fearless or brave in the face of adversity, while "shameless" describes someone who has no shame or sense of embarrassment or guilt, often behaving in an inappropriate or brazen manner.

For example, a firefighter who enters a burning building to save lives can be described as dauntless, as they are displaying courage in the face of danger. On the other hand, a con artist who lies and cheats others without any remorse or sense of wrongdoing can be described as shameless, as they are acting without any sense of shame or guilt.

While both adjectives are used to describe people who display a strong sense of self-confidence, "dauntless" is generally a positive trait associated with bravery and courage, while "shameless" is often viewed as a negative trait associated with a lack of empathy or consideration for others.

"Brazen manner"(ÂéöÈ°èÁÑ°ÊÅ•ÁöÑÊñπÂºè) refers to behavior that is bold, shameless, or audacious, often to the point of being disrespectful or inappropriate. When someone behaves in a brazen manner, they are often doing so with a sense of confidence or defiance, even in the face of potential consequences.

For example, if someone makes an outrageous or offensive remark in a public setting and does not seem to care about the reaction of those around them, they are behaving in a brazen manner. Similarly, if someone commits a crime in broad daylight and makes no attempt to hide their actions, they are also behaving in a brazen manner.

The term "brazen" can be used to describe various types of behavior, including speech, actions, or attitudes. It suggests a disregard for social norms or conventions, as well as a willingness to take risks or act in ways that others might find shocking or inappropriate. (It's like me)

### spoiling the story

A background story is a well-known cram school teacher and a normal mother owning lunchbox store, and it shows lots of realism between parents

- thanks for not totally spoiling the story , I guess I can relate to this ^^

- One Piece - well. I'm at episode 1042 now, i will never outgrow OnePiece

The phrase "spoiling the story" refers to revealing important plot details or twists that may ruin the surprise or suspense for someone who hasn't watched/read the story yet. In this context, "thanks for not totally spoiling the story" means the person appreciates that the previous speaker didn't give away too much information about the story they were talking about, so they can still enjoy it without knowing everything that happens.
The phrase "spoiled out" is not a common English expression. It's possible that it was a typo or a mistake in the original text.

### Is the daunting the opposite word of dauntless?

Yes, "daunting" can be considered the opposite of "dauntless" in terms of their meanings. While "dauntless" describes someone who is fearless or courageous, "daunting" describes something that is intimidating or overwhelming, often causing someone to feel discouraged or fearful.

For example, a difficult challenge or a new responsibility can be described as daunting, as it can be overwhelming and make someone feel hesitant or discouraged. On the other hand, someone who takes on that challenge with courage and determination can be described as dauntless.

While "dauntless" is generally viewed as a positive trait, "daunting" is often viewed as a negative or challenging situation that needs to be overcome.
