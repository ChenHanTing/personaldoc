### You are the epitome of what i will call a blessing for me in my life

"Call a blessing" means to refer to something as a blessing or to consider it a blessing. In the context of your sentence, it suggests that the person sees me as a significant positive influence or source of support in their life, someone they consider to be a blessing.

When you say something is "the epitome" 縮影, you're saying it represents the best or most typical example of its kind. So, "you are the epitome" means "you are the perfect example" or "you embody the ideal characteristics." For instance, if someone says, "She is the epitome of kindness," they're saying that she represents the highest standard of kindness.

epitome - 縮影

2. Theirs was a love-hate friendship, marked by passionate arguments followed by heartfelt reconciliations.
3. He has a love-hate relationship with social media; he enjoys staying connected but despises the negativity it often breeds.

### alarmed_at and alarming_at

The naming convention you choose for the column that records the time of an alarm should clearly reflect the data it represents and align with any existing naming patterns in your database or application. Between "alarmed_at" and "alarming_at," the two have slightly different implications:

- `alarmed_at`: This is generally understood to mean the exact time when the alarm was triggered. It’s past tense, indicating the time the event has occurred.

- `alarming_at`: This suggests the time when the alarm is set to go off. It's more future-oriented, as if the alarm is scheduled to happen.

In most cases, `alarmed_at` would be the appropriate choice because it’s a common convention for timestamp columns to record the time an event occurred, and using past tense provides clarity that the event has already taken place.

### desinate

"Designate" is a versatile word that can be used in various contexts. It typically means to appoint, choose, or indicate something for a specific purpose or role. Here are a few examples of how you can use the word "designate" in sentences:

1. **To Appoint or Assign**: "The manager will designate a team leader for the project."
2. **To Specify or Identify**: "Please designate your preferred method of payment on the form."
3. **To Label or Name**: "The sign designated the parking area for visitors only."
4. **To Indicate Officially**: "The government has designated this area as a protected wildlife reserve."
5. **To Allocate or Reserve**: "They will designate a portion of their budget for charitable donations."

In each of these examples, "designate" is used to signify the act of assigning, specifying, or indicating something for a particular purpose or role.

### Take precedence over

The correct phrase is "take precedence over."

"Precedence" refers to the condition of being considered more important than someone or something else; it's about priority or superiority. So, when something "takes precedence over" something else, it means it is given priority or considered more important than the other thing.

For example:

- "In emergency situations, safety takes precedence over all other concerns."
- "The needs of the project took precedence over personal interests."

You would not typically say "take precedent to" or "take precedent with" in English.

### ingress and egress

In networking, "ingress" and "egress" refer to the direction of network traffic relative to a specific point in the network, usually a switch, router, or other network device.

- **Ingress**: This term refers to traffic that is entering a network device or network. For example, when data packets arrive at a router's interface from an external source, that traffic is considered "ingress" to the router.

- **Egress**: Conversely, egress refers to traffic that is exiting a network device or network. When packets leave a router's interface to go to another network or device, this is considered "egress" traffic from that router.

Understanding the difference is important for various networking tasks, such as configuring quality of service (QoS), setting up firewalls, or monitoring traffic flows. When applying ACLs or firewall rules, you must know whether the rules should apply to ingress traffic, egress traffic, or both.

### Mocha and matcha

"Mocha" typically refers to a type of coffee that combines espresso with steamed milk and chocolate flavoring or cocoa powder.

On the other hand, "抹茶" (pronounced as "mǒchá" in Mandarin Chinese) refers to "matcha" in English, which is a type of finely ground powder of specially grown and processed green tea. Matcha has a unique flavor and is often used in traditional Japanese tea ceremonies, as well as in various desserts and beverages for its distinct taste and vibrant green color.

### rep

The term "rep" is often used as an abbreviation for "representative." The full name of a representative would depend on the context. It could refer to a political representative, such as a member of parliament (MP) or a congressperson, in which case their full name would be whatever they are individually named. For example, in the U.S. Congress, a representative's full name might be something like "John Smith" or "Jane Doe."

### Full Scope

### Gotta jam/bounce

The phrases "gotta jam" and "gotta bounce" are essentially the same in meaning. Both are informal, slang ways of saying that one needs to leave quickly. They're often used in casual conversations among friends. The context in which they're used is typically light-hearted, and they suggest a sense of urgency or a need to depart promptly.

The phrase "gotta jam" originates from musical contexts. "Jamming" traditionally refers to musicians playing music together in an impromptu, informal manner, often without any specific structure or plan. It's a creative, free-flowing session. Over time, the term "jam" evolved in slang to mean hanging out or doing an activity with a similar sense of spontaneity and enjoyment.

When someone says "gotta jam" in the context of needing to leave, it carries over that sense of immediacy and spontaneity. It suggests moving quickly and perhaps even with a bit of style or flair, similar to how musicians might start playing suddenly. The term has been adopted more broadly in everyday language to signify a quick departure, maintaining that casual, upbeat connotation.

### On monday or at monday

Both "on Monday" and "at Monday" are commonly used to indicate timing, but they are used in slightly different contexts.

1. "On Monday": This is the more common and widely accepted usage. It refers to something happening on a specific day of the week. For example: "I have a meeting on Monday."

2. "At Monday": This usage is less common and might sound awkward to native English speakers. "At" is typically used for specifying a particular time within a day, not for specifying a day itself. For example: "I have a meeting at 10:00 AM on Monday."

So, if you want to indicate that something will happen on a particular Monday, "on Monday" is the correct choice.

The speaker is emphasizing that the effort put into developing this function won't be wasted because it will be adapted or reused for other purposes in the future. This reassures the team that their work will have long-term value and applicability beyond the immediate project.

The idea is to create a function that is versatile and can be used in different scenarios. By "repurpose," it means that the function will not be limited to just one specific use case but will be designed in a way that it can be adapted or applied to various situations. This approach maximizes the utility of the function and ensures that the effort invested in developing it adds value across multiple contexts.
