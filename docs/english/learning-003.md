### 顏色繽紛的磚瓦

- The phrase "繽紛的磚瓦" in Chinese can be translated to "colorful tiles" or "vibrant bricks and tiles" in English. It's often used to describe the lively and varied colors of tiles or bricks, possibly on a building or pavement, giving a sense of diversity and cheerfulness.

- "sprinkle" can be related to the term "繽紛" in Chinese, which means colorful or variegated, often used to describe a mix of bright and diverse colors. While "sprinkle" in English primarily means to scatter small drops of liquid or particles of powder over an object or surface, it can metaphorically relate to "繽紛" when used to describe the action of adding a variety of colors in a scattered, light, and random manner, similar to how one might sprinkle multicolored decorations on a cake.

### Prudent

"Prudent" is an adjective that describes a person or action that is wise and careful in practical affairs. It signifies good judgment, caution, and discretion in managing risks or making decisions. A prudent person thinks ahead, carefully considers the consequences of their actions, and often avoids unnecessary risks.

Here are a few examples of how "prudent" is used in sentences:

- It is prudent(=wise) to save money for unexpected expenses.
- The investor took a prudent approach to her portfolio, diversifying assets to minimize risk.
- Making a budget and sticking to it is a prudent way to manage personal finances.

### Intra- and Inter-

The prefixes "intra-" and "inter-" are used in English to form words that describe relationships or interactions. Their meanings are distinct:

1. **Intra-**:

   - "Intra-" is a prefix meaning "within" or "inside".
   - It is used to form words that describe something occurring or existing within a single group, structure, or context.
   - Examples:
     - **Intracellular**: Occurring within a cell.
     - **Intranet**: A private network accessible only within an organization.
     - **Intramural**: Taking place within a single educational institution.

2. **Inter-**:
   - "Inter-" is a prefix meaning "between" or "among".
   - It is used to form words that describe something occurring or existing between two or more groups, structures, or contexts.
   - Examples:
     - **International**: Between or among nations.
     - **Internet**: A global network connecting millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks.
     - **Interpersonal**: Between people; often used to describe skills in interacting with others.

### Cut corner

Tom said to me："Because frugal means you're trying to cut corners."

The phrase "cut corners" is an idiom that means to take shortcuts or find an easy way out, usually in a manner that compromises quality, ethics, or safety. It often refers to doing something as cheaply or as quickly as possible at the expense of a higher standard of work. The phrase **carries a negative connotation**, suggesting a lack of thoroughness or attention to detail.

Using "cut corners" in a sentence usually implies a criticism or **a warning against doing something improperly** or haphazardly.

Here are a few examples of how it's used:

1. **In Business or Work**: "The construction company was accused of cutting corners when it was discovered they used substandard materials."
2. **In Personal Tasks**: "You shouldn't cut corners when preparing a meal for a large group; food safety is important."
3. **In Academics**: "Students who cut corners in their studies may find themselves struggling in more advanced classes."

### Before you had to deal with the pressure of any mishaps that occurred, but now I own equal responsibility

**Does any mishaps have the same meaning of "any lapses"?**

In this context, "any mishaps" can be similar in meaning to "any lapses." Both phrases refer to mistakes, errors, or unforeseen problems

Although there are subtle differences in their connotations:

1. **Mishaps**:
   - A mishap is generally an accidental or unlucky event that results in damage, inconvenience, or other undesirable outcomes.
   - It implies an element of bad luck or unforeseen circumstance.
   - Example: "The mishap at the event was due to unforeseen weather conditions."
2. **Lapses**:
   - A lapse typically refers to a temporary failure of concentration, memory, or judgment.
   - It can imply a brief or minor failure in a system or process, often due to human error or negligence.
   - Example: "There was a lapse in communication that led to the confusion."

In the sentence "Before you had to deal with the pressure of any mishaps that occurred, but now I own equal responsibility," replacing "mishaps" with "lapses" would slightly shift the focus from general accidents or unlucky events to instances of oversight or judgment errors. However, the overall meaning of the sentence remains largely the same.

### Eavesdrop and overhear

_引言：The encrypted version of SMB protects against eavesdropping and prevents man-in-the-middle attacks_

Eavesdropping and overhearing both involve listening to conversations, but they differ in intent and context:

- **Eavesdropping**（竊聽）: This is usually done secretly or without the knowledge of the people being listened to. It often carries a negative connotation, suggesting that the listener is intentionally trying to hear private conversations to gather information they are not entitled to.

- **Overhearing**（不小心聽到）: This typically happens unintentionally. Someone might overhear a conversation because they are in close proximity to the speakers, not because they are trying to listen in. Overhearing doesn't imply the same level of secrecy or intent to invade privacy as eavesdropping does.

### 漏聽、漏看

_問題：漏看的英文叫 overlook，那為什麼漏聽的英文不叫 overhear？_

如果要解釋無意中沒聽見，通常會說 "I missed hearing that"。如果是因為距離遠或其他原因而沒有聽見某個信息，則可以說 "I didn't catch that" 或 "It was inaudible to me"。

overhear 通常指無意中聽到他人的對話，並不涵蓋因注意力不集中或其他原因而沒聽見的情況。如果你指的是因為注意力分散而漏聽，那可能沒有一個與 "overlook" 直接對應的詞，但可以說 "I wasn't paying attention and didn't hear that."

### Overlook & Oversight

- **Overlook（沒看到）**:
  這個詞作為動詞使用，意思是忽略或未注意到某事物。例如：“The manager overlooked the error in the report.”（經理沒有注意到報告中的錯誤。）

- **Oversight**（沒看到＋失誤）:
  作為名詞，它有兩個主要的意思。一是指疏忽或失誤，即某事被忽略或未被注意到，例如：“There was an oversight, and the important email was not sent.”（出現了一個疏忽，重要的郵件沒有發送。）
  另一個意思是監督或監察，指的是對某項工作或過程的監管，例如：“The committee is responsible for the oversight of the financial auditing process.”（委員會負責監督財務審計過程。）

  **另外比較 oversight & lapse 的不同：**

  "Lapse" and "oversight" are terms that can both refer to an error or mistake, but they are used in slightly different contexts:

  - **Lapse**: This typically refers to a temporary failure of concentration, memory, or judgment. A lapse can be a momentary slip or small mistake, often due to a brief period of inattention. For instance, forgetting to send an important email could be considered a lapse.

  - **Oversight**: As mentioned before, this can either mean an unintentional omission or error due to inattention, or it can refer to the act of overseeing or monitoring. When used to describe an error, it usually means something was not considered or missed during a process of review or inspection.

  While both terms can relate to mistakes made by not paying attention, "lapse" often suggests a more personal and momentary error, while "oversight" can imply a missed detail in a broader process or responsibility.

### Adjust, modify and tweak. It's nuanced inn't

"adjust," "modify," and "tweak" are nuanced words, each with distinct implications:

- "Conquer" suggests overcoming challenges or difficulties.
- "Adjust" implies making minor changes to adapt or accommodate.
- "Modify" means making alterations or adjustments for specific purposes.
- "Tweak" implies fine-tuning or making slight improvements.

These words vary in intensity and the extent of change they imply, so choosing the right one depends on the specific context and the level of change or adjustment needed.

### How much is it to bump it up to next plan?

The phrase "How much is it to bump it up to the next plan?" means the person is inquiring about the cost or price increase associated with upgrading to a higher-tier subscription or service plan. They want to know the additional amount they would need to pay to move from their current plan to a more advanced one.

The usage of "bump" in the context of "bump up to the next plan" is not related to a salary bump. In this context, "bump" means to move up or increase something, such as upgrading to a higher service plan. "Salary bump" refers to an increase in one's salary or income. The two terms have different meanings and are used in different contexts.

"salary bump" can imply an increase in salary, which is similar to moving up to a higher level of income. However, the term "bump up to the next plan" specifically refers to upgrading to a higher level of service or subscription plan, not a salary increase. While they both involve an increase, they are used in different contexts—one related to financial compensation and the other related to service or subscription levels.

### My brain isn't braining anymore

The phrase "My brain isn't braining anymore" is a humorous way of saying that someone is having trouble thinking or functioning properly. It's a play on words where "braining" is used as a humorous verb to describe the act of thinking or processing information. The sentence suggests that the person is experiencing a mental block or is unable to think clearly.

### Actually quite consistent... happens after every "generate" click

- Me: i tested this and it works to me. Does the error occur intermittently

- Michelle:

  actually quite consistent... happens after every "generate" click

  however, it saves the work despite the error.

  hit "generate" -> crash -> refresh -> content is magically generated -> repeat on the next area

The phrase "actually quite consistent" suggests a high level of regularity or predictability in an occurrence, but it doesn't necessarily mean it happens every single time without exception. It indicates that the event occurs frequently or under similar conditions, but there may be occasional deviations.

When someone says "happens after every 'generate' click," this part of the statement implies that the occurrence is linked directly to the action of clicking 'generate' and it happens each time this action is taken.

Putting it together, if something is "actually quite consistent... happens after every 'generate' click," it suggests that the event regularly occurs in response to the 'generate' click, but the use of "quite consistent" instead of "always" leaves room for occasional exceptions. However, in practical terms, it often implies a very high degree of consistency, especially in a technical or mechanistic context where actions typically have predictable outcomes.

### I sense something happen flashback

❌ It's a wrong usage

To make the sentence more coherent, you might consider rephrasing it. Here are a few options, depending on what you're trying to convey:

1. **If you're recalling a past event:** "I sense a flashback of something happening."
2. **If you're describing a feeling about a past event:** "I have a feeling that something happened, almost like a flashback."
3. **If you're experiencing a sudden memory:** "I suddenly recall something happening, like a flashback."

Each of these rephrased sentences provides a clearer idea of sensing or remembering a past event.

### Have chops in there

The phrase "to have chops" is an idiomatic expression meaning to have a high level of skill or expertise in a particular area. It's often used in informal contexts to commend someone's proficiency or talent. The term "chops" in this phrase originally referred to a musician's technical skill (particularly in jazz), but it has since broadened to apply to various fields.

When someone says "to have chops in there," they are likely referring to someone having considerable skills or abilities in a specific area or activity. The "in there" part of the phrase might be emphasizing the particular field or context in which the person is skilled.

For example:

- "She really has chops in graphic design" means she is very skilled at graphic design.
- "He has the chops to be a great chef" suggests he has the necessary skills to excel in cooking.

### Everything looks right, just need a **push thru**

The phrase "push through" in this context means to continue or proceed with effort and determination, despite facing difficulties, challenges, or resistance. It suggests a need for persistence or extra effort to overcome obstacles and complete a task or achieve a goal.

When someone says "Everything looks right, just need a push through," they are indicating that while things are generally on track or correct, there is still a need for a final effort or decisive action to successfully finish or realize the task at hand. This can involve persevering through the last stages of a project, dealing with any remaining challenges, or simply maintaining momentum until completion.

### provide right off the bat thing

The phrase "right off the bat" is an idiom in English that means immediately, without delay, or from the very beginning. It is often used to describe something that happens very quickly and without any hesitation or waiting period.

For example:

- "She knew right off the bat that the job was perfect for her." This means she realized immediately that the job was a good fit.
- "He answered the question right off the bat." This suggests he responded immediately, without needing time to think.

The origin of the phrase is believed to be from baseball, where a batter begins to run immediately after hitting the ball ("off the bat").

### set in stone

This idiom means something is fixed, unchangeable, or permanent. It originates from the ancient practice of carving laws or important information in stone, signifying that these were not to be altered. When you say that a plan, decision, or rule is "set in stone," it implies that it cannot be easily changed or modified.

Here's an example to illustrate the use of the phrase "set in stone":

Imagine you are part of a project team at work, and your team has been discussing various deadlines for a project. After a lot of back-and-forth, the team finally agrees on a specific date for the project's completion. Your manager then says, "Okay, let's consider this deadline set in stone. We can't afford any more changes, as our clients are expecting delivery on this date."

In this example, "set in stone" is used to emphasize that the deadline is now fixed and unchangeable. The team is expected to commit to this date and not seek further alterations.

### alleviate the concern

The phrase "alleviate the concern" means to reduce, lessen, or ease a worry or concern. It's about taking steps to make a problem or issue less severe or troubling. When you alleviate a concern, you address something that is causing stress or anxiety and work to diminish its impact. This can be done through various means such as providing information, taking corrective action, offering reassurance, or finding solutions to the underlying causes of the concern.

For example, if someone is worried about the safety of a product, providing evidence of rigorous safety testing could alleviate their concern. Or, if there's a concern about meeting a deadline, reallocating resources or adjusting the timeline could help to alleviate it.

### a lot more barebone

The phrase "a lot more barebone" typically refers to something that is significantly more basic, stripped down, or minimalistic in nature or design. When something is described as "barebone," it usually means that it lacks additional features, embellishments, or complexities that are not essential to its primary function. This term can be applied to various contexts, such as technology, products, programs, or plans.

For instance:

- In the context of a computer or software, "a lot more barebone" might mean a very basic setup with only the essential components or functionalities, without any additional features or user interface enhancements.
- For a plan or project, it could imply a simplified version that focuses only on the most crucial elements, removing any non-essential parts or details.

Overall, the emphasis is on simplicity, essential functionality, and the absence of extras or frills.

### not embedded

"not embedded" usually refers to something that is **not firmly or deeply integrated, inserted, or established** within a particular context, system, or environment.

For example, in a technological context, if a feature is "not embedded" in a software program, it means the feature is not built into or integrally part of the software. In a cultural or organizational context, a practice or idea that is "not embedded" is one that is not yet fully incorporated or accepted as a norm within that culture or organization.

### get our hands dirty

The phrase "get our hands dirty" is an idiomatic expression that means to involve oneself in the hard work or detailed aspects of a task or situation, often when the work is considered difficult, complex, or messy. It implies a readiness to engage with the practical side of things rather than staying in a planning or supervisory role.

### do some surgery

"We need to do some surgery" is another idiomatic expression, which typically means that some detailed, precise, and careful work needs to be done to fix or improve something. In a non-medical context, it suggests that something requires careful attention to detail and possibly significant changes or corrections.

"After reviewing the quarterly losses, it's clear that we need to do some surgery on our budget. It's time to get our hands dirty and make some tough decisions on where we can cut costs without compromising our growth."
