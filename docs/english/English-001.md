### Last 2 orders just got cancelled too. This is bringing me back **flashback**

The phrase "bringing me back flashback" isn't standard English. The correct phrase would be "giving me a flashback" or "bringing back flashbacks." The term "flashback" refers to a sudden and often vivid memory of a past experience, especially one that is emotionally significant. Here's how you could use "flashback" in a sentence:

### We haven't had much time to **revitalize** all aspects of our flow but we expect to soon

My question:

How to use the word revitalize. I saw my mate use it like this: "we havent had much time to revitalize all aspects of our flow but we expect to soon." It seems like the intensified version of "resume"?

Answer from chatGPT:

The word "revitalize" means to imbue(注入) something with new life and vitality; it implies restoring energy, vigor, or freshness(活力、精力或新鲜) to something that has become tired, less efficient, or outdated. It's more than just resuming; it's about improvement and rejuvenation.

In the context of your mate's sentence: "We haven't had much time to revitalize all aspects of our flow but we expect to soon."

Here, "revitalize" suggests that there is an intention not only to continue or resume their workflow but to enhance and inject it with new energy or improved methods. It could mean they're looking to optimize processes, introduce innovations, or make their flow more efficient and productive. It's about taking what exists and making it better, more dynamic, or more effective.

先解釋什麼是 Downright

"Downright" is an adverb often used to emphasize or intensify the meaning of an adjective or another adverb, typically in the context of describing something in a very clear, straightforward, or extreme way. It's similar to saying "absolutely" or "totally." Here are a few examples to illustrate its use:

2. **Accentuating Positives**: "Her performance was downright amazing." (Meaning her performance was exceptionally good.)

4. **Expressing Strong Feelings**: "His remarks were downright offensive." (Meaning his remarks were completely and unambiguously offensive.)

In each instance, "downright" works to strengthen the word it's modifying, leaving no room for doubt about the intensity or degree of the statement.

解釋三個字之間的比較

The word "downright" is indeed similar to slang terms like "flipping" or "mad" when used for emphasis, but there are some nuances in their usage and connotation:

1. **"Downright"**: This adverb is used to emphasize the extreme nature or degree of something. It can be used in both positive and negative contexts, as in "downright amazing" or "downright awful." "Downright" is generally considered formal or standard English.

2. **"Flipping"**: This is a colloquial, somewhat informal term often used to add emphasis. It's a milder, non-offensive alternative to certain other intensifying swear words. For example, "flipping incredible" or "flipping ridiculous." It's more casual and might be more common in spoken English or informal writing.

3. **"Mad"**: In slang usage, especially in certain dialects like British English, "mad" can be used to mean "very" or "extremely," as in "mad excited" or "mad good." This usage is quite informal and more common in casual conversation.

While all three can serve a similar function of intensifying the meaning of an adjective or adverb, "downright" is standard and neutral, "flipping" is informal and somewhat euphemistic, and "mad" (in this context) is very informal and more colloquial. The choice between them would depend on the context and the desired tone of the conversation or writing.

### ~ is called "tilde" in English

In English, the symbol "~" is called a "tilde." The usage of the tilde can vary in different contexts:

### I have a feeling Tom would have some push back on this though

3. "Make waves": Suggests causing controversy or disruption in a previously calm environment.

4. "Cross the line": The phrase "push buttons" can indeed imply more than just provoking or teasing.

It conveys a sense of uncertainty, delay, or being in a state of suspension, **often causing discomfort or anxiety** due to the lack of resolution or progress.（很不確定的會發生什麼事，但還是觀察看看）

This expression originates from the word "limbo," which traditionally refers to an uncertain, undefined, or intermediate state or condition. In various religious beliefs, limbo is a state of existence between heaven and hell, where one's fate is yet to be decided. The idiomatic use borrows this sense of being in an undefined, intermediate stage.

In the context of your sentence, "sitting in limbo" implies that the individuals are in a state of uncertainty or waiting, particularly concerning their credit card status. They are unsure of what the problem is and are likely waiting for clarification or a resolution.

### I don't like that because you know, like I said, we're **working our butts off** and if anything, that just causes more stress on all of us, right.

The phrase "working our butts off" is an informal and emphatic way of saying that someone is working very hard or exerting a great deal of effort. It's often used to convey intense dedication, long hours, or particularly challenging work. The phrase is colloquial and adds a vivid, somewhat humorous tone to the description of hard work.

My question: But why working our butts off, it's not easily to associate to put a lot of effort

The origin of this phrase, like many idioms, is not precisely clear, but it generally implies working to the point of exhaustion, as if one worked so hard that parts of their body (metaphorically their "butt") would fall off due to the extreme effort. This exaggerated imagery is common in idioms, used to convey a message in a vivid and memorable way.

### Getting everything like, just imagine what we've accomplished right with the with the small team that we have, you know, having sanity, this **pretty dope ass CMS**, you know, we have built a fully customized checkout experience and you know, so yeah.

So, a "dope ass CMS" refers to a Content Management System (CMS) that is exceptionally good or impressive. A CMS is software that helps users create, manage, and modify content on a website without the need for specialized technical knowledge.

### So I mean, **take it with** **a grain of salt**.

The phrase "take it with a grain of salt" is a metaphorical expression that means to maintain a degree of skepticism or not to take something too seriously. The metaphor suggests that one should view certain information or advice with caution and not accept it as completely true or reliable without further verification.

The origin of this expression dates back to ancient times. It is often associated with a story involving the Roman general Pompey, who is said to have come across a recipe for an antidote to poison (毒藥的解藥) which recommended taking the antidote with a small amount of salt. The idea was that the grain of salt was necessary to make the antidote effective, but over time, the phrase evolved in meaning. Today, it implies that a bit of skepticism (the "grain of salt") can be a useful way to temper or moderate one's acceptance of something.

In essence, when someone advises you to "take it with a grain of salt," they are suggesting that you should not take what they are saying as absolute truth or be overly influenced by it, but rather, you should use your own judgment and consider the possibility that the information might not be completely accurate or applicable in every situation.

The phrase "Kevin's buck up" in your context seems to be a miscommunication or misinterpretation of a more common expression. It's likely that the intended phrase was either "Kevin's mix-up" or "Kevin's screw-up."

1. **"Kevin's mix-up"** would imply that Kevin was involved in or responsible for a confusion or mistake regarding the situation. A "mix-up" is a common term for a mistake or error caused by confusion or misunderstanding.

2. **"Kevin's screw-up"** is a more informal and slightly harsher way of saying that Kevin made a significant error or blunder. "Screw-up" often implies a more serious mistake or mishandling of a situation.

In the context of your sentence, it seems that there was a logistical error involving the scanning and location of the Y70s, and the phrase is used to attribute or relate this mistake to Kevin. The correct expression would depend on the severity and nature of the mistake and the speaker's intention in describing it.

This sentence could be paraphrased for clarity as: "I've added you to the chat so you can stay updated and avoid being caught off guard by any unexpected developments."
