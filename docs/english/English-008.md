### Compare per se to /poor-kwa/, do people borrow the former more than later

"per se" is borrowed from Latin and is used much more commonly in English conversation and writing in the United States than "pourquoi," (為什麼) which is French for "why." The phrase "per se" is used to express the idea of "in itself" or "by itself," indicating that something is considered in its own nature without regard to external factors. For example, "The idea isn't bad per se, but it's not suitable for our current needs."

"Per se" has been adopted into English legal, academic, and general vocabulary, where it's used to make precise distinctions. Its use is widespread among English speakers who may not even realize they're using a Latin phrase due to its integration into the language.

In contrast, "pourquoi" remains distinctly recognized as a French word and is not commonly used by English speakers outside of contexts specifically relating to the French language, culture, or when directly quoting French. Thus, "per se" is indeed borrowed and used far more frequently in English conversations and texts in the U.S. than "pourquoi."

"Per se" is a phrase borrowed from Latin, where it means "by itself" or "in itself." It has been incorporated into English and is used to indicate that something is inherently or intrinsically the case, without considering any other factors. The phrase has been widely adopted in various fields, including law, philosophy, and everyday English, to make precise distinctions or clarifications about the nature of something being discussed.

### Composure

"Composure" refers to the state of being calm and in control of one's emotions, especially in a difficult situation. It's about maintaining your cool and not letting stress, pressure, or adversity affect your behavior or decision-making. For example, someone demonstrating great composure might remain calm during a crisis, not showing panic or distress, and making rational decisions.

### Afterhours

"After hours" can refer to several contexts depending on how it's used:

1. **Business or Workplace**: Refers to the time period outside of the regular operating or business hours. For example, if a business operates from 9 AM to 5 PM, "after hours" would be any time before 9 AM or after 5 PM.

2. **Stock Market**: Refers to trading that takes place after the official trading hours of the stock exchanges have ended. The regular trading hours for the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ, for example, are from 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern Time, so "after hours" trading would occur before 9:30 AM or after 4:00 PM.

3. **Social Context**: Can also refer to activities or events that happen late in the evening or at night, typically implying a social, leisure, or entertainment context outside of normal business hours.

The specific meaning of "after hours" depends on the context in which it is used.

### Spend a week under the covers?

"Spend a week under the covers" typically implies staying in bed for an extended period, often a week, for various reasons. This phrase can be used literally or figuratively, depending on the context:

1. **Literally**: It can mean spending a significant amount of time in bed, possibly due to illness, recovery from surgery, depression, or simply wanting to rest and be away from the usual activities and responsibilities.

2. **Figuratively**: It might be used metaphorically to describe a period of withdrawal from social activities or daily routines, possibly for mental health breaks, reflection, or escape from stress and pressures.

3. **Leisure and Relaxation**: In a more positive light, it could also refer to taking a vacation or a break from work, where one chooses to relax and stay in bed, watch movies, read books, or enjoy other leisure activities without the intention of leaving the house much.

The context in which it's used can greatly affect its connotation, ranging from a need for physical or emotional healing to a simple desire for relaxation and downtime.

### I'm pretty sly

Saying "I'm pretty sly" suggests that you consider yourself to be clever, cunning, or able to achieve your goals through clever means, often in a subtle or underhanded way. The term "sly" implies a certain level of intelligence and craftiness, perhaps in solving problems, navigating social situations, or achieving objectives without drawing much attention to your methods. It can have both positive connotations, as in being resourceful and ingenious, and negative ones, as in being deceitful or manipulative.

### Cat butler 是貓奴的意思嗎？

"Cat butler" is a playful and affectionate term used in English to describe what is referred to as "貓奴" in Chinese, which translates directly to "cat slave." Both terms humorously suggest the idea that the cat owner serves their cat in a way that the cat is the master and the human is the servant or butler, attending to all of the cat's needs and whims. This concept reflects the loving, often whimsically subservient relationship many cat owners feel they have with their pets, where they go to great lengths to ensure their cats are happy, comfortable, and well-cared for.

### Crafting an effective pitch

Crafting an effective pitch for yourself depends on the context in which you're presenting it—whether it's for a job interview, a networking event, a business proposal, or another scenario. However, a good self-pitch generally covers the following elements: who you are, what you do, what you're looking for, and how you can benefit the listener or organization. Here's a structured approach you can tailor to your needs:

1. **Introduction**: Start with a brief introduction that includes your name and an engaging statement about your professional identity or passion.

   "Hello, my name is [Your Name], and I'm a passionate [Your Profession/Field of Interest] with a strong background in [Key Skill or Experience]."

2. **Background and Skills**: Highlight your educational background, relevant experiences, and key skills that make you stand out. Focus on achievements and experiences that are most relevant to your audience.

   "I graduated from [Your School] with a degree in [Your Degree], and have worked on [Relevant Projects or Roles] that allowed me to hone my skills in [Skill 1], [Skill 2], and [Skill 3]."

3. **Unique Selling Proposition (USP, 独特销售主张)**: Mention what makes you unique. This could be a particular combination of skills, a unique approach to problems, or a passion project.

   "What sets me apart is my ability to [Unique Skill or Approach], which I demonstrated when I [Specific Achievement or Project]. This experience taught me valuable lessons in [Skill or Lesson Learned], and I'm eager to bring this perspective to new challenges."

4. **Objective**: Clearly state what you're looking for. Whether it's a job, a collaboration opportunity, or a chance to join a particular project, be specific about your goals.

   "I'm currently seeking opportunities to apply my skills in [Industry/Field], where I can contribute to [Type of Work or Projects], and continue growing professionally, particularly in areas related to [Specific Interest or Skill]."

5. **Call to Action**: End with a statement that invites further conversation or action. Provide a simple next step for the listener.

   "I'd love the chance to discuss how my background and skills could contribute to your team. May I share my portfolio with you, or could we schedule a time to talk more in detail?"

Remember to adapt your pitch based on your audience, keeping it concise and focused. Practice your pitch to ensure it sounds natural and confident.

Typically, overlays are used to display additional information, images, or interactive elements without navigating away from the current page or context.

### Drop in the bucket

The phrase "drop in the bucket" is an idiom that means a very small or insignificant amount in comparison to what is needed or expected. It's used to illustrate that something, though it may contribute to a larger cause or total, is so minimal that its impact is barely noticeable. This expression is often employed to convey the idea that while an effort or contribution is recognized, it does not substantially alter the overall situation or solve a large-scale problem. The imagery evokes the notion of a single drop of water falling into a large bucket, highlighting how inconsequential one drop is in filling it or making a noticeable difference to the volume of water already present.

"let me see what i can do Han but it sounds to me like the new opportunity is something u cant pass up with all the benefits that comes with it.  i think you staying on part time will help the team a lot until we can find new developers. " -- by Tom

It seems like you're asking for clarification on the phrase "is something you can’t pass up with all benefits?" This phrase suggests that the opportunity being discussed is very attractive and offers significant advantages, making it hard to decline. The context implies that there are substantial benefits associated with this new opportunity, which outweigh the reasons for staying in the current situation. The suggestion that staying on part-time would be beneficial until new developers are found indicates a desire to maintain support for the current team while still taking advantage of the new opportunity.

### On a personal level, ...

It seems like you're starting a sentence with "in the personal level," which could be leading into a more detailed statement. If you're looking to complete or correct that phrase for clarity or grammatical accuracy, a common way to express this idea would be: "On a personal level, ..."

This phrase is often used to introduce a statement that reflects personal opinions, feelings, or circumstances. If you have more to add or need further assistance, please let me know!

### Play it by ear

"Play it by ear" is an idiomatic expression that means to proceed or make decisions spontaneously, based on the current situation rather than following a planned strategy or set of rules. It originates from the way some musicians play music without reading from a score, relying instead on their memory of the tune and their ability to listen and adapt as they go.

When someone suggests to "let's just play it by ear," they are proposing to stay flexible and decide on the next steps as events unfold, rather than committing to a specific plan of action in advance. This approach is often used in situations where uncertainty is high, and it's deemed more practical to adjust to circumstances as they develop.

### concall

"Concall" is an abbreviation for "conference call." It's a telephone call in which someone talks to several people at the same time. Conference calls are used frequently in business environments to conduct meetings with participants who are in different locations.

This could involve tucking the ends of your hair under a headband or into a roll and securing it, giving the appearance of a seamless style without visible ends. It's a popular, easy-to-achieve hairstyle that works well for medium to long hair lengths and can be adapted for casual or formal occasions.

   在发型造型的背景下，“藏起来并覆盖”是指一种简单的发型技巧，即将头发藏起来（通常是末端或其中一部分），然后以某种方式覆盖，以创造出整洁、精致的外观。这可能涉及将头发的末端塞进一个发带或卷起来固定，使其看起来像无缝风格而没有可见的末端。这是一种受欢迎且易于实现的发型，适用于中长到长发，并可以根据休闲或正式场合进行调整。



### As long as it's committed on SAP, it's good.

When someone says "it's committed on SAP," they are referring to the action or process of finalizing and recording a transaction or data entry in the SAP system. SAP, which stands for Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing, is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software used by businesses to manage business operations and customer relations.

In the context of SAP or similar ERP systems, "committing" data typically means that the data has been saved in a way that it cannot be easily altered or deleted. This can refer to various types of transactions, including financial entries, orders, inventory changes, or any other business transaction that needs to be accurately and securely recorded in the system. Once data is committed in SAP, it becomes part of the official records of the company, affecting reports, financial statements, and operational insights.

The commitment of data in SAP is a crucial step in ensuring the integrity and reliability of business information. It signifies that the transaction has been finalized within the system and will be reflected in the company's records and reports.

Using "commit" in conversations, especially in informal or day-to-day contexts, often relates to making a promise, undertaking an obligation, or dedicating oneself to a cause, activity, or relationship. Here are several examples to illustrate different ways you can use "commit" in conversations:

1. **Making Plans or Promises:**  
   - "I commit to helping you with your project this weekend."  
   This means you are promising to help, indicating a clear intention to dedicate your time and effort.

2. **Personal Goals and Resolutions:**  
   - "This year, I've committed to getting in shape and eating healthier."  
   Here, "commit" is used to express a personal dedication to achieving specific health goals.

3. **Relationships:**  
   - "We've decided to commit to each other and are moving in together."  
   In this context, "commit" signifies a mutual decision to take a relationship to a more serious level.

4. **Professional and Work-related Commitments:**  
   - "I'm fully committed to this project, and I'll do whatever it takes to make it successful."  
   This sentence conveys a strong dedication to seeing a project through to success.

5. **Team Sports or Group Activities:**  
   - "If you join the team, you need to commit to attending all practices and games."  
   This usage of "commit" involves agreeing to meet the obligations of being part of a team.

6. **Ethical, Moral, or Political Stances:**  
   - "I commit to standing up for equality and fighting discrimination in all forms."  
   Here, "commit" is used to express a pledge to adhere to certain principles or causes.

7. **Learning and Education:**  
   - "I'm committing two hours every day to learn a new language."  
   Indicates a decision to dedicate a specific amount of time regularly to an educational pursuit.

8. **Financial Decisions:**  
   - "We're not ready to commit to buying a house just yet; we need to save more money."  
   In this example, "commit" refers to making a significant financial decision with long-term implications.

In conversations, using "commit" effectively communicates a sense of responsibility, determination, and dedication to a chosen task, goal, or promise. It's a powerful word that should be used with sincerity, as it conveys a strong intention to follow through on what has been said.

### Other way around

- A: So basically what you're saying that if if we change the status and becomes, it needs to sink back to Zonos.
- B: Other way around
- A: because the onus is is, is the taking ownership of taking the customers payment right. There are the middle men right for us, so we have to cancel through their portal and update through Bigcommerce cuz if you cancel through Bigcommerce it does nothing.

### file a complaint

- I don't know if there's any legal grounds for that.
- They can probably file a complaint and then obviously it will just fix it, but I don't think they could take us straight to court.
- OK cause I I I basically told Jeff if we ever went into that situation, the easiest way to go about it would be just to turn off check out for that region temporarily until we figure it out.

### take us straight to court

The phrase "take us straight to court" refers to the action of initiating legal proceedings or filing a lawsuit against a company or individual without pursuing alternative dispute resolution methods first. This means that the aggrieved party chooses to immediately seek a legal remedy through the court system, bypassing steps such as negotiations, mediation, or arbitration that might resolve the issue without involving the courts.

### I cannot help me. I'm committed

The phrase "I cannot help me. I'm committed" seems to convey a sense of being unable to change one's situation, decision, or course of action due to a commitment. It suggests that the speaker feels bound by a decision or obligation they have made, to the extent that they see no way to alter their circumstances or choices, even if they wanted to.

However, the phrase is somewhat unconventional in its wording. A more common expression of this sentiment might be, "I can't help it; I'm committed," which more clearly communicates that the speaker is obligated or dedicated to a certain path and feels unable to deviate from it due to their commitment.

This statement can apply to various contexts, such as personal decisions, professional obligations, or contractual agreements, where the individual feels the weight of their commitment and perceives it as limiting their ability to change direction or seek alternatives.

## 加值

首先，加值和儲值的英文可以用 **add value** 來表達，這裡的 value 指的是「**價值、價格**」，在後面通常會加上 **to** 來表示「**把錢加值到⋯⋯**」的意思。而除了 add value 以外，如果想用 **add cash** 或是 **add money** 來表達也是可以的哦～😉

加值、儲值的英文還可以用 **top up** 這個片語來表示。top up 原本有「**加滿、補足**」的意思，用來指「**根據原有的內容再往上添加，以達到使用者想要的程度**」。因此，這個片語除了指將容器添滿以外，也可以表達儲值的意思。

接下來要介紹的這三個單字，是在原本的 fill（填滿）、load（裝載）、charge（收費）這幾個字前面加上「 **Re-** 」的字首來表示**再次**的意思，用來指「**再添加、再填滿**」，也常用來表達加值、儲值的意思，可以當動詞或名詞使用。不過，這些字比較沒有前面兩個單字來得那麼直觀，在不同情境可能代表別的意思，因此，較適合在上下文清楚的情況下表達。

- I would like to **add value** to my card.
  我想要把錢加值到我的卡片裡

- If you have **added value** to your card, you can check the balance on the card reader.
  如果你已經儲值了你的卡片，你可以在讀卡機上檢查卡片的餘額

- Do you know how to **add cash** to this laundry card?
  你知道要怎麼儲值這張自助洗衣卡嗎？

- You can **add money** to this card at the information desk over there.

  如果你啟動卡片的自動加值功能，就不用花時間排隊儲值了

### What's the diffenerce between timely and responsive

The word "timely" refers to something done or occurring at a favorable or appropriate time, implying promptness or suitability in timing. While "responsive" suggests reacting quickly and positively, "timely" specifically emphasizes the aspect of timing—being neither too early nor too late. Here's how to use "timely" in various contexts, with examples to illustrate its meaning and usage:

1. **In the context of responses or actions:**  
   - "The firefighter's timely intervention saved the building from greater damage."  
   This means the firefighter acted at just the right moment to prevent further harm.

2. **Regarding submissions or deliveries:**  
   - "Submitting your application in a timely manner is crucial for it to be considered."  
   Here, "timely manner" means submitting the application early enough to meet the deadline, but not so early that it's premature.

3. **In reporting or news:**  
   - "The news report provided a timely update on the situation."  
   This suggests the update was given at an appropriate time to inform the audience effectively, possibly when they needed the information the most.

4. **In the context of planning or management:**  
   - "Timely planning will ensure we meet our project deadlines without any rush."  
   This means planning activities at the right times to avoid last-minute pressures.

5. **When referring to advice or assistance:**  
   - "Her timely advice helped me avoid making a serious mistake."  
   This indicates the advice was given at the perfect time to be useful or effective.

While both "timely" and "responsive" indicate a form of promptness, "responsive" leans more towards the idea of reacting to something, whereas "timely" focuses on the right or opportune timing of an action or event.

### "timing factors" not "timely matter"

If you're aiming to express that the status of an order can change based on various timing factors—such as promotional periods, payment deadlines, or stock availability—here's a way to phrase it that incorporates the concept of time affecting order status:

"The status of an order can be affected by different timing factors, including promotional deadlines, payment timings, and stock availability. Timely action is crucial to ensure you benefit from promotions and avoid issues like stock shortages or missed payment deadlines."

This sentence communicates that the order's status isn't static and can be influenced by how promptly actions are taken in relation to time-sensitive events or conditions.

The word "timely" in such a context to emphasize the importance of acting within a specific timeframe to benefit from a promotion or to avoid missing out on an opportunity due to stock shortages or other time-sensitive constraints. Here's how you might phrase it:

"It's important to place your order in a timely manner to take advantage of the promotion. Failure to pay on time could result in missing out on the offer, and there's a risk the item could be out of stock if you try to repay at a later date."

In this sentence, "timely manner" underscores the need to act quickly to secure the benefits of the promotion and to avoid the consequences of delayed action, such as the product being out of stock (OOS).

### How to use "set in stone"

The phrase "I feel excited to set in stone to this platform" is not grammatically proper or standard for a few reasons:

1. **Incorrect Use of "Set in Stone":** The phrase "set in stone" typically means to make something unchangeable or permanent. It's often used in contexts where decisions, plans, or rules are being described as final and not subject to alteration. The phrase does not smoothly apply to the action of committing to a platform, as "committing" or "dedicating oneself" would be more appropriate verbs.

2. **Prepositional Error:** The structure "to set in stone to this platform" is awkward because "to set in stone" does not naturally pair with "to" when indicating the object of the commitment. If you're aiming to express a strong commitment to a platform, a more direct and clear verb should replace "set in stone."

3. **Clarity and Precision:** The original phrase is vague and doesn't clearly convey what it means to commit to a platform. Are you excited about using it, contributing to it, or something else?

A more appropriate way to express excitement and commitment could be:

- "I'm excited to fully commit to this platform."
- "I'm thrilled to dedicate myself to using this platform."

These alternatives avoid the misuse of "set in stone" and more directly state the intended enthusiasm and commitment.

#### 睜一隻眼閉一隻眼

”睜一隻眼, 閉一隻眼” 的說法是 **turn a blind eye (to…)** 字面上的意思是 ”把瞎掉的那隻眼轉向...” 也就是刻意不去理會之意

> The police in Taiwan usually turn a blind eye to street vendors.
> (台灣的警察對攤販通常睜一隻眼, 閉一隻眼)

> The teacher turned a blind eye to cheating.
> (這名老師對作弊的行為睜一隻眼, 閉一隻眼)

> How can she turn a blind eye to her husband cheating?
> (她怎能對她老公的外遇睜一隻眼, 閉一隻眼呢?)

### I know you are trying to hide in that 12 hour time difference

### ... and withhold from your payouts

從您的付款中扣除

Travis is correct regarding what would need to happen in the UPS label API call coming from shipstation on Zonos orders. Otherwise, UPS will send you the invoice for the duties and taxes we calculate, collect, and withhold from your payouts (you get shipping and product totals). I can say that until now, we have not had success in requesting SS do this development, to conditionally change their UPS API calls when Zonos is involved.

In the context provided, "payouts" refer to the payments made by Zonos to you, the seller or merchant, after collecting funds. Specifically, these payouts would include the total amounts collected for the product(s) sold and the shipping costs associated with these transactions. The discussion involves the calculation, collection, and withholding of duties and taxes by Zonos on international orders. Zonos handles these financial aspects to ensure compliance with international shipping regulations and to streamline the process for merchants.

Payouts can occur in various contexts and are not exclusively for business-to-business (B2B) transactions. The term "payout" broadly refers to the act of paying out money to any party, which can include businesses, individuals, affiliates, contractors, and more, depending on the context. Here are a few common scenarios where payouts might be used:

1. **Business to Business (B2B)**: Companies may issue payouts to other businesses for services rendered, partnerships, or as part of contractual agreements. For example, a retailer might issue a payout to a wholesaler for a bulk purchase of goods.

2. **Business to Consumer (B2C)**: Businesses may provide payouts to consumers in the form of refunds, rewards, or cashback offers. For example, an e-commerce platform might give a customer a refund for a returned item.

3. **Business to Affiliate/Partner**: In affiliate marketing, companies issue payouts to individuals or entities that generate leads, sales, or traffic through affiliate links. For example, a blogger may receive a payout for referring customers to a company's products or services.

4. **Gig Economy and Freelancers**: Platforms that connect freelancers or gig workers with tasks or projects often issue payouts to these individuals upon the completion of work. For example, a ride-sharing service issues payouts to drivers for the rides they provide.

5. **Prizes and Winnings**: Organizations that run contests, lotteries, or gaming platforms may issue payouts to winners.

6. **Dividends**: Companies issue payouts in the form of dividends to their shareholders as a distribution of profits.

In summary, while B2B transactions can indeed involve payouts, the use of the term is much broader and can encompass a wide range of payment scenarios across different types of relationships and contexts.

The term "payouts" in a business context generally refers to the payments made by a company to its vendors, partners, or affiliates. These payments can be for a variety of purposes, such as revenues earned, services rendered, or as part of a payment plan for products sold.

The term "月結" in Chinese translates to "monthly settlement" or "end-of-month settlement." This term is used to describe a payment or accounting arrangement where transactions over the course of a month are settled at the end of that month.

While "payouts" and "月結" are related in the sense that both involve payments, they are not exactly the same. "Payouts" is a more general term that can apply to any kind of payment distribution, regardless of the schedule. "月結," on the other hand, specifically refers to the timing of these payments, indicating that they are settled on a monthly basis.

### Echo your sentiment

To "echo your sentiment" means to agree with, support, or reflect the feelings, opinions, or attitudes that someone else has expressed. It's a way of saying that you share the same viewpoint or emotions regarding a particular matter. This phrase is often used in conversations or writings to show solidarity or understanding with what another person has stated, indicating that the speaker or writer feels similarly or identifies closely with the sentiments that have been shared.

### Gist

要點

In everyday conversation, the "gist" means the main point or essence of a speech, conversation, text, or matter. When someone asks for the "gist" of something, they're seeking a brief summary or the most important aspects without all the details. For instance, if you missed a meeting, you might ask a colleague, "Can you give me the gist of what was discussed?"

### nitty-gritty and willy-nilly

The term "willy-nilly," which might be what you’re referring to (as "nilly willy" is less common), is an adverb meaning without direction or planning; haphazardly or carelessly. When someone does something willy-nilly, they do it spontaneously, without careful thought or organization. It can sometimes have a negative connotation, implying a lack of consideration or deliberation.

The term "nitty-gritty" refers to the most essential and fundamental aspects of something. It is often used to describe getting down to the core details of a situation, topic, or task. When someone says they're getting down to the nitty-gritty, they mean they are focusing on the most important and practical details.

### 背夾擠

When referring to the action during a push-up where the back muscles contract or squeeze together, the term you might be described as "scapular retraction" or "squeezing the shoulder blades together." In the context of push-ups or other exercises, this action engages the muscles of the upper back, including the rhomboids and trapezius, and is important for proper form and effective targeting of the muscles.
