### I just want to make it so that we don't even have like, that, that discussion of even having this sick server is off the table, right? Cause that should be the last resort. You know.

In your statement, you used two idiomatic expressions, "off the table" and "last resort," which convey different but related ideas:

1. **Off the Table**: When something is "off the table," it means that it is no longer being considered as an option or solution. It's a way of saying that a particular idea, proposal, or course of action has been removed from discussion or consideration. In your context, suggesting that having a "sick server" is "off the table" implies that you want to ensure this option is not considered or pursued.

2. **Last Resort**: The term "last resort" refers to the final option or a course of action that is taken only when all other alternatives have been exhausted or deemed unsuitable. It's used to describe a measure that should only be used when there are no other viable options left. In your statement, saying that the "sick server should be the last resort" implies that relying on this server should only be done if absolutely no other solution is available.

"Last resort" is a phrase used to describe a final option or course of action, taken only after all other alternatives have been considered and found wanting or not feasible. It's typically used in situations where the remaining option might not be ideal, but is necessary under the circumstances. Here are some examples to illustrate its use:

1. **Emergency Measures**: "Calling the emergency services should be a last resort, only if we can't handle the situation ourselves."

2. **Difficult Decisions in Business**: "Laying off employees is our last resort to keep the company afloat during this financial crisis."

3. **Personal Relationships**: "I really don't want to end our friendship over this disagreement. Let's try to talk it out first; ending the friendship should be a last resort."

4. **Medical Treatment**: "Surgery is considered a last resort for this condition, only if all other treatments fail."

5. **Conflict Resolution**: "We should try all diplomatic channels to resolve this conflict. Military intervention is a last resort."

6. **Financial Solutions**: "Taking out a high-interest loan should be your last resort if you absolutely need the funds and have no other options."

In each of these examples, "last resort" is used to emphasize that the action or decision is not the first choice, but rather something to be considered only when other methods or approaches have been tried and have not succeeded or are not possible.

The phrase "off the table" is used to indicate that a certain option, idea, or proposal is no longer being considered or is not available for discussion or negotiation. It suggests that the specific option has been removed from the range of possibilities. Here are some examples to illustrate how to use "off the table":

1. **Negotiations**: "During the peace talks, unilateral military action was taken off the table as a condition for continued dialogue."

2. **Business Decisions**: "Due to budget constraints, the option of expanding the marketing team is currently off the table."

3. **Personal Choices**: "Given the health risks involved, skydiving is completely off the table for me."

4. **Policy Making**: "The government has declared that tax increases are off the table in the upcoming budget."

5. **Relationship Discussions**: "If moving to another city is off the table, we need to consider other ways to handle our long-distance relationship."

6. **Project Planning**: "Given the time constraints, redesigning the entire system is off the table for this phase of the project."

In each instance, "off the table" is used to clearly communicate that a particular option or course of action is not being considered as part of the decision-making process. This phrase is often used to set boundaries or limits on what can be discussed or decided upon in various scenarios.

### Intent and Intention

In your statement, the terms "intent" and "intention" are both relevant, but they have slightly different nuances:

1. **Intent**: This word refers to the state of mind with which an action is done. "Intent" often emphasizes the determination or purpose behind an action. In the context of your statement, referring to "malicious intent" suggests a deliberate desire or plan to cause harm or disruption, especially in the context of hacking or DDoS attacks.
2. **Intention**: This term usually refers to a planned or desired outcome, often focusing more on the future result one wants to achieve. "Intention" can imply a broader range of plans or desired outcomes, not just the immediate purpose or motive.

In the context of your statement, "intent" is more fitting as it emphasizes the deliberate and purposeful nature of the malicious activities being discussed. However, "intention" could also be used, especially if referring to the broader goals or outcomes the hackers aim to achieve with their actions.

### On tinkering

"On tinkering" could refer to the act of making small changes or adjustments to something, usually as a way to repair, improve, or fine-tune it. Tinkering is often associated with a hands-on, experimental approach to solving problems or enhancing the functionality of devices, machines, or systems. It implies a degree of informal or hobbyist activity, often done by enthusiasts or professionals who enjoy working on projects in a more exploratory and iterative manner. If you're referring to a specific context or need more detailed information, please let me know!

### You're green screening yourself into a theropy session

It seems like the image is from a television show where a person is talking about "green screening" themselves into their therapy sessions. Green screening, also known as chroma keying, is a visual effects/post-production technique for layering two images or video streams together based on color hues (chroma range). This technique is commonly used in film and television to composite (combine) two images together in a way that makes it appear as though they are part of the same scene. It often involves filming the subject in front of a green background and then replacing that background with another image during the editing process. This enables the integration of the subject into any scene without physically being there.

### 碩士的第二年

In English, "碩士的第二年" translates to "the second year of a master's degree."

### How refreshing

The phrase "How refreshing!" is often used to express a sense of pleasure, relief, or enjoyment in response to something that feels pleasantly different, new, or invigorating. It's typically used to comment positively on a situation, idea, or experience that stands out as enjoyable or a welcome change from the norm. 

For example:
1. After hearing an honest and straightforward opinion in a situation where you usually encounter evasiveness: "How refreshing to hear someone speak so candidly!"
2. Experiencing a cool breeze on a hot day: "How refreshing!"
3. Encountering a new approach in a typically conventional setting: "This innovative design is so different from what we're used to seeing. How refreshing!"

In these contexts, the phrase is used to express a sense of enjoyment or approval.

### resolution=status? I saw "resolution" on Jira

In JIRA, the terms "resolution" and "status" are related but distinct concepts:

1. **Status:** This indicates the current stage of an issue in its workflow. Common statuses include "Open," "In Progress," "In Review," and "Closed." Status is dynamic and changes as the issue moves through different stages of the workflow.

2. **Resolution:** This field is specifically used to indicate how an issue was resolved, or if it has been resolved at all. It provides additional information about the outcome of an issue once it reaches a status that implies completion, like "Closed." Resolutions might include "Fixed," "Won't Fix," "Duplicate," etc.

While both resolution and status provide information about the state of an issue, the resolution is specifically used to denote the final outcome of an issue, especially when the issue is considered closed or completed. In some workflows, an issue isn't considered truly "closed" until a resolution is set, even if its status is "Closed." This helps in tracking and reporting on how issues are resolved over time.

"Upgrade the resolution" typically refers to improving the quality of an image or video by increasing its pixel count. This results in a sharper, clearer picture with more detail. In the context of digital images or videos, a higher resolution means more pixels are used to represent the image, which enhances its clarity and detail.

### Renal

In Chinese, the term for "renal" or "related to the kidneys" is 腎

### Willy-nilly

"Willy-nilly" is an English expression that means "without direction or planning; haphazardly." It's often used to describe something done without careful consideration or organization, implying a sort of carelessness or lack of control. For example, "The papers were scattered willy-nilly across the desk."

### 最低錄取分數

The English translation of "最低錄取分數" is "minimum admission score" or "minimum entry score." This term is commonly used in the context of academic admissions, referring to the lowest score a candidate must achieve to be considered for acceptance into a program or institution.

### X equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four ac, all over two a

In verbal English, the equation you've shown would be expressed as "X equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four a c, all over two a." This is known as the quadratic formula, which is used to find the solutions to a quadratic equation of the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).

To clarify, the phrase "all over" refers to the entire expression being divided by \( 2a \). So the correct verbal expression of the formula would be:

"X equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four ac, all over two a."

This means that the sum of "negative b" and the square root of "b squared minus four ac" is divided by "two a."

The phrase "out of" can indeed be used interchangeably with "all over" in the context of division in the quadratic formula. The expression "X equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four ac, out of two a" conveys the same meaning: the entire numerator is divided by the denominator "2a." This is a less formal but still commonly understood way of expressing division in spoken English.

### Example sentences for backdrop

Certainly, here are some example sentences using the word "backdrop":

4. The historical paintings on the walls served as a fascinating backdrop to the museum's exhibits.
5. The colorful sunset created a breathtaking backdrop for their romantic picnic by the beach.

### The search isn't pulling anything up

The phrase "pulling anything up" typically means retrieving, displaying, or accessing information, data, or results in a given context. It's often used to describe the act of searching for something in a database, software application, or digital system and getting relevant results or responses.

For example, in the context of a search engine, if someone says, "The search isn't pulling anything up," it means that the search query isn't returning any results or the results are not relevant. In a software development context, particularly with version control systems like Git, if a merge request isn't "pulling anything up," it might mean that the request is not retrieving or showing the expected code changes or differences.

The phrase can be used in various situations where information retrieval is involved, and not finding expected results or data is an issue.

### Go off of this

The phrase "go off of this" in your context is an informal way of saying "use this as a starting point" or "base your work on this document." The speaker is suggesting that the person they are addressing should take the document mentioned as the foundational information or reference for beginning their work, specifically for creating a version of the NAV (Net Asset Value) and setting up a staging environment. The speaker also implies that the document includes a list of products, which should also be considered or included in the task.

### 一寸照片

"一寸照片" in English translates to "one-inch photo." This typically refers to a small photograph, often used for official documents like passports, identification cards, and visas, where the face or headshot portion of the photograph is about one inch in size.

### Recalibrate

The word "recalibrate" means to adjust or set something in a different way or with a new understanding, often to improve accuracy or efficiency. It is commonly used in technical contexts, like adjusting the settings of a machine or instrument, but can also be used metaphorically in other areas. Here are some examples of how to use "recalibrate" in sentences:

1. **Technical Use**: 
   - "We need to recalibrate the printer to ensure the colors are accurate."
   - "After replacing the parts, the technician recalibrated the machine to ensure it was working correctly."

2. **Personal or Professional Development**:
   - "I'm taking this course to recalibrate my skills for the digital age."
   - "After receiving feedback, she recalibrated her approach to the project to better align with the team's objectives."

3. **Adjusting Plans or Strategies**:
   - "Due to the market changes, the company needs to recalibrate its business strategy."
   - "The unexpected event forced us to recalibrate our plans for the trip."

4. **Reassessing Beliefs or Attitudes**:
   - "The new information made him recalibrate his opinion on the matter."
   - "She recalibrated her expectations to be more realistic about the project's timeline."

In each of these examples, "recalibrate" is used to convey the idea of making adjustments, often based on new information, to improve or correct something.

Not necessarily. "In timed with" and "sequentially" have different meanings.

- "Sequentially" refers to something happening in a sequence, one after the other, or in a specific order. For instance, "The tasks were completed sequentially according to the project plan."

So, they are not interchangeable, and the choice between them depends on the context you are trying to convey..
