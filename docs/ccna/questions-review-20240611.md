[Question](https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/45737-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-226-discussion/#): Which technology is used to improve web traffic performance by proxy caching?

- A. WSA ✅
  **Function**: The Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) is designed to improve web traffic performance through various means, including proxy caching. It caches web content to reduce bandwidth usage and accelerate content delivery to users.
- B. Firepower
  **Function**: Cisco Firepower is a next-generation firewall and intrusion prevention system (IPS) that focuses on advanced threat protection and network security.
- C. ASA
  **Function**: Cisco ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance) is a security device that provides firewall, VPN, and intrusion prevention capabilities.
- D. FireSIGHT
  **Function**: Cisco FireSIGHT is a management console for Firepower devices, used for centralized management and monitoring.

What mechanism carries multicast traffic between remote sites and supports encryption?

- A. ISATAP

- B. IPsec over ISATAP

- C. GRE

- D. GRE over IPsec ✅

  CCNA security course Ipsec dosent support multicast, that is why GRE used with VPN, and as long as the GRE is not totally secure, the whole GRE. Encapsulation can be encapsulated in ipsec header so nlw we have both " mulitcast ability and security"

  IPsec cannot encapsulate multicast, broadcast, or non-IP packets, and GRE cannot authenticate and encrypt packets. Based on the same principle, these applications encapsulate packets as IP packets using GRE and then transmit the packets over IPsec tunnels

If it asked about the root bridge, the following is the standard and the process of Root Bridge Election

- **Bridge Priority**: Default is 32768, but it can be manually configured to be lower to make a specific switch the root bridge.
- **MAC Address**: If the bridge priorities are the same, the switch with the lowest MAC address becomes the root bridge.

You're right. Let's take another look and analyze the differences properly to determine the correct configuration.

### Configuration C

```plaintext
enable
configure terminal
ip nat pool mypool 192.168.3.1 192.168.3.3 prefix-length 30
access-list 1 permit 10.10.0.0 0.0.0.255
ip nat inside source list 1 pool mypool
interface g1/1
 ip nat inside
interface g1/2
 ip nat outside
```

Configuration D

```plaintext
enable
configure terminal
ip nat pool mypool 192.168.3.1 192.168.3.3 prefix-length 30
access-list 1 permit 10.10.0.0 0.0.0.255
interface g1/1
 ip nat inside
interface g1/2
 ip nat outside
```

Key Differences

- **Configuration C** includes the command `ip nat inside source list 1 pool mypool`, which is necessary to map the inside local addresses to the global addresses using the NAT pool.
- **Configuration D** is missing this crucial command, meaning it does not complete the NAT configuration as it lacks the instruction to perform the address translation.

The correct configuration is **Configuration C** because it includes the necessary command to set up the NAT translation:

```plaintext
ip nat inside source list 1 pool mypool
```

Final Answer

- **Correct Configuration**: **C**
- **Incorrect Configuration**: **D**

Configuration C properly configures NAT by including the command to map addresses using the NAT pool, while Configuration D is incomplete without this command.

- A. It requires 10Gb ports on all uplinks. ❌
- B. It supports between 1 and 50 users. ✅
- C. It supports between 50 and 100 users. ❌
- D. A router port connects to a broadband connection. ✅
- E. It requires a core, distribution, and access layer architecture. ❌

Answer: 

B. It supports between 1 and 50 users: SOHO environments are typically designed to serve a small number of users, ranging from a single user (a home office) up to around 50 users in a small office setup.

D. A router port connects to a broadband connection: In SOHO environments, a common setup involves a router connecting to a broadband internet connection, such as DSL, cable, or fiber, to provide internet access to the connected devices in the home or office.

AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) override is used to apply different security policies to different users or groups based on their credentials. It doesn't affect band selection or congestion.

Band Select is a feature that encourages dual-band clients to connect to the less congested 5-GHz band rather than the more crowded 2.4-GHz band. This improves overall network performance and can help enhance voice quality by reducing congestion.

1. **Static Route (AD = 1)**: Since static routes have an AD of 1, they are usually the most preferred routes after directly connected routes.

2. **eBGP (AD = 20)**: Less preferred than static routes.

3. **EIGRP (AD = 90)**: Less preferred than eBGP and static routes.

4. **OSPF (AD = 110)**: Least preferred among the given options.

> - An SNMP manager
> - An SNMP agent
> - A Management Information Base (MIB)
>
> The Management Information Base (MIB) is a virtual information storage area for network management information, which consists of collections of managed objects. With SNMP, the network administrator can send commands to multiple routers to do the backup.

[Question](https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/41387-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-59-discussion/): Which two WAN architecture options help a business scalability and reliability for the network? (Choose two.)

- A. asychronous routing

- B. single-homed branches

- C. dual-homed branches ✅

  Dual-homed branches: Dual-homing involves connecting each branch office to two or more different WAN links, such as two different service providers, in order to provide redundancy and increase reliability. This architecture option enables the business to maintain network connectivity even if one of the WAN links fails. In addition, it can also provide better performance and scalability by balancing traffic across the multiple links.

- D. static routing

- E. dynamic routing ✅

  Dynamic routing: Dynamic routing protocols enable routers to dynamically exchange information about the network topology and find the best path for data to travel. This allows for faster convergence in case of network changes and improves network scalability by automatically adjusting to changes in the network. Dynamic routing protocols also increase network reliability by providing redundancy and failover mechanisms.

I'm right. The provided answer in VCE player is wrong

The static routes are:
Network + Interface (Source interface) or Next Hop (IP Address Neighbor).

So, you have 4 possibilities:
💙 Atlanta = ipv6 route::/0 2012::2/126 or
Atlanta = ipv6 route::/0 Serial 0/0/0
💙 Washington= ipv6 route::/0 2023::2/126 or
Washington= ipv6 route::/0 Serial 0/0/0

IMO i would imagine the actual question stating "(Choose two)" at the end to close out the question leaving the answers to be A &' B.. But if the question is given as-is &' i could only choose One answer, E is the only choice that can apply to BOTH Atlanta &' Washington Routers.

What are two functions of a server on a network? (Choose two.)

- A. handles requests from multiple workstations at the same time **Most Voted**
- B. achieves redundancy by exclusively using virtual server clustering
- C. housed solely in a data center that is dedicated to a single client achieves redundancy by exclusively using virtual server clustering
- D. runs the same operating system in order to communicate with other servers
- E. runs applications that send and retrieve data for workstations that make requests **Most Voted**

> 💙💛🧡💜 If an answer choice has definitive language like "exclusively" or "solely" it's usually wrong.
>
> 💙💛🧡💜
> A. Correct .Servers are designed to handle requests from multiple clients or workstations simultaneously. This is one of their primary functions in a network environment. Examples of server types include web servers, file servers, and database servers. 
> E. Correct. One of the main functions of a server is to run applications that serve data and services to workstations that request them. This can include applications like web servers, email servers, and database servers.
>
> B. Incorrect. Virtual server clustering involves grouping multiple virtual servers together for improved availability and fault tolerance. While it can achieve redundancy, it's not the exclusive way to achieve redundancy, and it's not a direct function of a server. 
> C. Incorrect. This option does not describe a general function of servers on a network. While dedicated data centers and virtual server clustering might be strategies used for redundancy, this option is not a common function of servers. 
> D. Incorrect. Servers on a network can run different operating systems depending on their roles and the needs of the network. Communication between servers does not necessarily require them to run the same operating system.

What is a function of a remote access VPN?

- A. establishes a secure tunnel between two branch sites
- B. uses cryptographic tunneling to protect the privacy of data for multiple users simultaneously
- C. used exclusively when a user is connected to a company's internal network
- ✅ D. allows the users to access company internal network resources through a secure tunnel

Options A, B, and C are not accurate descriptions of the function of a remote access VPN:

- A describes a site-to-site VPN.

- B is partially correct but does not fully capture the primary function specific to remote access VPNs.

- C is incorrect as remote access VPNs are used specifically for accessing the company's network from an external location

C. **enforcing routing policies**

In a two-tier architecture, the collapsed core layer combines the functions of both the core and distribution layers, which includes enforcing routing policies. This layer is responsible for high-speed connectivity and routing between different segments of the network.

### Port security

Setting the switch port to access mode is necessary before configuring port security. This ensures that the port functions as an access port, which connects to an end device such as a computer or printer, rather than a trunk port, which connects to another switch.

Here’s an example of configuring port security on FastEthernet 0/1:

````txt
Switch(config)# interface FastEthernet0/1
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security
Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security maximum 2
Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security violation restrict
Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security mac-address sticky
````

To verify the port security configuration, use the following command:

```
Switch# show port-security interface FastEthernet0/1
```
