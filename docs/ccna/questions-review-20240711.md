### Other Questions

When you configure SSH with public key authentication, users authenticate using a cryptographic key instead of a password. This method enhances security and convenience as users do not need to type a password

```
R1(config)# hostname R1
R1(config)# ip domain-name example.com
R1(config)# crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048
R1(config)# username admin privilege 15
R1(config)# ip ssh public-key-chain
R1(conf-ssh-pubkey)# username admin
R1(conf-ssh-pubkey-user)# key-string
R1(conf-ssh-pubkey-data)# ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEArVz... user@host
R1(conf-ssh-pubkey-data)# exit
R1(conf-ssh-pubkey-user)# exit
R1(conf-ssh-pubkey)# exit
R1(config)# line vty 0 4
R1(config-line)# login local
R1(config-line)# transport input ssh
R1(config)# ip ssh version 2
R1(config)# end
R1# write memory
```

**Authentication:** When the user connects to the router, the SSH client uses the private key to authenticate. If the private key matches the public key stored on the router, the user is granted access without needing to type a password.

```txt
R1(config)# ip ssh public-key-chain
R1(conf-ssh-pubkey)# username admin
R1(conf-ssh-pubkey-user)# key-string
R1(conf-ssh-pubkey-data)# ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEArVz... user@host
R1(conf-ssh-pubkey-data)# exit
R1(conf-ssh-pubkey-user)# exit
R1(conf-ssh-pubkey)# exit
```

Trunk ports are set individually on each interface. However, the configuration also includes `channel-group` commands, which are used to create an EtherChannel. This allows multiple physical links to be combined into a single logical link, providing increased bandwidth and redundancy.

When configuring EtherChannel, you don't need to set trunk configuration on the logical port (Port-Channel interface) separately if you already configured it on the individual physical interfaces. The configuration applied to the physical interfaces will be inherited by the Port-Channel interface.

When configuring EtherChannel, you still need to set each member port as a trunk individually before adding them to the channel group. This ensures that all the member ports have the same configuration, which is necessary for the EtherChannel to function correctly.

```plaintext
SW1(config)# interface range fastEthernet 0/1 - 2
SW1(config-if-range)# switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
SW1(config-if-range)# switchport mode trunk
SW1(config-if-range)# switchport trunk allowed vlan 100, 200, 300
SW1(config-if-range)# channel-group 1 mode on
```

```plaintext
SW2(config)# interface range fastEthernet 0/1 - 2
SW2(config-if-range)# switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
SW2(config-if-range)# switchport mode trunk
SW2(config-if-range)# switchport trunk allowed vlan 100, 200, 300
SW2(config-if-range)# channel-group 1 mode active
```

The configuration at the following is thorough and ensures that both the physical interfaces and the logical port-channel interface are set up correctly. This approach can be considered best practice

```txt
SW1# configure terminal
SW1(config)# interface range fastEthernet 0/1 - 2
SW1(config-if-range)# switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
SW1(config-if-range)# switchport mode trunk
SW1(config-if-range)# switchport trunk allowed vlan 100, 200, 300
SW1(config-if-range)# channel-group 1 mode on
SW1(config-if-range)# exit
SW1(config)# interface port-channel 1
SW1(config-if)# switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
SW1(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
SW1(config-if)# switchport trunk allowed vlan 100, 200, 300
SW1(config-if)# exit
```

```txt
SW2# configure terminal
SW2(config)# interface range fastEthernet 0/1 - 2
SW2(config-if-range)# switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
SW2(config-if-range)# switchport mode trunk
SW2(config-if-range)# switchport trunk allowed vlan 100, 200, 300
SW2(config-if-range)# channel-group 1 mode active
SW2(config-if-range)# exit
SW2(config)# interface port-channel 1
SW2(config-if)# switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
SW2(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
SW2(config-if)# switchport trunk allowed vlan 100, 200, 300
SW2(config-if)# exit
```

This configuration is indeed robust and ensures that all necessary settings are applied consistently. It combines the benefits of both detailed physical interface configuration and centralized logical interface management.

**Configuring a password for the console port (Option B)**:
**Logical Access Control**: While important for security, setting a password for the console port of a device controls access to the device‚Äôs management interface, not physical access. This is considered logical or administrative access control.

**Configuring enable passwords on network devices (Option D)**: 
**Logical Access Control**: Like Option B, configuring enable passwords restricts administrative access to the device‚Äôs configuration and management but does not affect physical access.

**Setting up IP cameras to monitor key infrastructure (Option A)**:
**Physical Access Control**: IP cameras provide surveillance and monitoring of physical spaces, helping to detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts. This is a direct method of controlling and securing physical access to critical infrastructure.

IP cameras are commonly used to monitor physical spaces and the activities of users within those spaces for security purposes.

Organizations often use IP cameras to ensure compliance with safety protocols and regulatory requirements. Monitoring workspaces helps ensure that safety practices are followed, which can prevent accidents and injuries.

**B is incorrect** because both RADIUS and TACACS+ can be used for various types of authentication, not just dial-up. While RADIUS has historical ties to dial-up networking, it is widely used today for wireless authentication (e.g., 802.1X), VPNs, and other network access types.

**RADIUS** encrypts only the password in the access-request packet, leaving other information (such as username and user attributes) in plaintext, and **TACACS+** encrypts the entire payload of the packet, providing a higher level of security for all transmitted data.

**B. The distribution layer runs Layer 2 and Layer 3 technologies.**

- The distribution layer serves as an intermediary between the access and core layers in a three-tier network architecture.
- It typically handles routing (Layer 3) and switching (Layer 2) functions, enabling efficient traffic management, policy implementation, and inter-VLAN routing.

R1 has `mtu 1600`, while R2 does not specify an MTU size, which defaults to 1500. This mismatch can prevent the OSPF neighbor relationship from being established.

**D. R1 has an incorrect network command for interface Gi1/0 is incorrect**: The network command on R1 is correct.

**B. R2 is using the passive-interface default command**
Both routers are using the `passive-interface default` command correctly and enabling OSPF on the necessary interfaces.

Both routers have `passive-interface default` and then `no passive-interface` for their respective interfaces, which is correct for enabling OSPF on the specified interfaces.

**Link-Local Addresses** are designed for communication within a single network segment and are automatically configured on each network interface. This automatic and unique configuration per interface ensures local communication without the need for manual setup.

Each network interface on a device is automatically assigned a link-local address, typically in the range FE80::/10. This address is unique to that interface and does not change unless manually configured

**Option C**: This option suggests isolating the native VLAN from other VLANs within the administrative domain. This can be interpreted as ensuring that the native VLAN is not used for regular traffic and is separated to reduce risks associated with VLAN hopping attacks. This aligns with the best practice of not using the default VLAN 1 and assigning a unique, isolated VLAN for the native VLAN. 

Both options are valid, but in the context of securing the native VLAN directly and technically preventing VLAN hopping, **option D** might be considered more specific and actionable.

In the context of VLANs, separating the native VLAN from other VLANs within the administrative domain means ensuring that the native VLAN is not used for regular user traffic or any other critical operations. This helps in mitigating potential security risks.

In a practical scenario, securing the native VLAN within the administrative domain involves:

- Changing the native VLAN from the default VLAN 1 to a unique VLAN ID.
- Ensuring that the native VLAN does not carry any regular user traffic.
- Configuring trunk ports to only allow necessary VLANs and pruning the native VLAN if it is not required.

**General Meaning of "Chassis"**

In networking and computing, the term **chassis** refers to the physical framework or structure **that houses and organizes** the various components of a device, such as a switch, router, or server. It can **include slots** for modules, power supplies, fans, and other hardware components.

**Coordinating VTNs (Virtual Tenant Networks)**:

- **Function**: The SDN controller can create, manage, and coordinate VTNs, which are virtual networks that provide network segmentation and isolation within a physical network.
- **Key Role**: VTNs are essential for multi-tenant environments where network resources need to be logically partitioned.

B is correct. In the absence of a manually configured router ID and loopback interfaces, OSPF will choose the highest IP address on any active physical interface.

D is incorrect. OSPF will never use 0.0.0.0 as a router ID; it will always choose a valid IP address based on the selection process.
