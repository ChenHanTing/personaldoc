**Suggested Answer:** *AE* [üó≥Ô∏è](https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/79779-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-488-discussion/#)

> A is 100% correct while the confusion between B and E is down to people missing two important differences for those two options. B is a direct host route and it will show up in the routing table as 10.10.10.10/32 and it is called a host route. Hence subnet mask being 255.255.255.255. Whereas, E option does NOT cover the host 10.10.10.10 address as if you calculate the subnet range for the subnet in option E it only goes up to 10.10.10.0 - 10.10.10.6 and .7 being its broadcast address. It's incrementing in blocks of 8 as the subnet mask clearly states 255.255.255.248 or /29. So, how exactly the router would send traffic to host .10 which is NOT even in the subnet range. Therefore, option E route will NEVER reach .10 host hanging off that router.

A DHCP client is any device (such as a computer, smartphone, or printer) that uses the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to automatically obtain an IP address and other network configuration settings from a DHCP server.

The option C is incorrect in the context of defining a DHCP client. However, it seems to refer to the DNS (Domain Name System) process rather than DHCP.

**B is incorrect**: LLC is a sublayer of the data link layer (Layer 2) in the OSI model. It deals with logical link control protocols, such as establishing and maintaining links, but it is not a QoS tool for guaranteeing bandwidth. 

**Low Latency Queuing (LLQ)**

LLQ is an extension of CBWFQ. It combines CBWFQ with priority queuing to provide a strict priority queue for real-time traffic (like voice and video). This ensures that latency-sensitive traffic is given the highest priority and minimum delay, while other types of traffic are handled by CBWFQ.

[Question](https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/82416-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-583-discussion/): Drag and drop the SNMP manager and agent identifier commands from the left onto the functions on the right.

The answers should be the following:
show snmp host: displays information about the SNMP recipient
show snmp chassis: displays the SNMP Client (not server) serial number
show snmp group: displays the snmp security model in use
show snmp community: displays the snmp access string
show snmp engineID: displays the snmp unique identifier (engineID) assigned to a SNMP entity

**Managing the Topology**:

One of the primary functions of an SDN controller is to manage the network topology. This includes discovering network devices, maintaining a view of the network structure, and making routing decisions based on the overall topology.

**Coordinating VTNs (Virtual Tenant Networks)**:

SDN controllers often manage Virtual Tenant Networks (VTNs). VTNs allow for the creation of isolated virtual networks on top of the physical network infrastructure. This helps in providing network services tailored to the needs of different tenants in a multi-tenant environment.

**Layer 2 Forwarding**:

While an SDN controller can make decisions about forwarding traffic, the actual forwarding is typically done by the network devices (switches, routers) based on the instructions provided by the SDN controller. The controller itself is not responsible for directly forwarding packets.

**C. default-gateway**:

This is not a valid command in the context of configuring a DHCP pool. This term is often used in the context of configuring a default gateway for the router itself, not for distributing it via DHCP.

**D. default-router**:

This is the correct command to specify the default gateway (router) that the DHCP clients should use. In the context of a DHCP pool configuration, this command is used to distribute the default gateway to the DHCP clients.

**Suggested Answer:** *C* [üó≥Ô∏è](https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/70214-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-559-discussion/#) 

>  Before an Network Management System (NMS) can handle an SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) trap from an agent, the NMS must have the appropriate Management Information Base (MIB) loaded. MIBs define the structure and attributes of the managed objects that an SNMP agent can send in traps. The NMS needs to understand the MIB associated with the trap to interpret and process the information received in the trap message. Therefore, having the correct MIB loaded is a prerequisite for handling SNMP traps effectively.

[Question](https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/82476-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-314-discussion/#): Which switch technology establishes a network connection immediately when it is plugged in?

````

**Shutdown Violation**: This is the default mode. When a port security violation occurs, the switch will place the port into the err-disabled state, effectively shutting it down. The port will need to be manually re-enabled or automatically re-enabled after a specified period if err-disable recovery is configured.

**Restrict Violation**: Similar to the protect violation, the switch will drop packets with unknown source MAC addresses. Additionally, it will log the security violation and increment the violation counter.

Importance of VTP Revision Number

- **Higher Revision Number**: Indicates a more recent VLAN database. If a switch with a higher revision number is introduced to the network, its VLAN database will overwrite the existing databases on other switches in the VTP domain.
- **Lower Revision Number**: Indicates an older VLAN database. Introducing a switch with a lower revision number will not affect the existing VLAN databases on other switches.

**A. Biometrics**

Biometrics refers to authentication methods based on physical characteristics such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans. While biometrics can be used for access control, the scenario specifically mentions badge readers, not biometric devices.

**B. Physical Access Control**

Physical access control involves securing physical access to facilities, rooms, or buildings. It includes mechanisms such as locks, badge readers, and security guards to restrict entry to authorized personnel only. The scenario describes installing badge readers, which is a typical example of physical access control.

**C. Multifactor Authentication**

Multifactor authentication (MFA) involves using two or more authentication methods to verify a user's identity. Examples include combining something the user knows (password), something the user has (token or badge), and something the user is (biometric data). The scenario doesn't mention using multiple factors for authentication, only badge readers.

**D. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

Role-based access control restricts system access to authorized users based on their roles within an organization. While RBAC can apply to both logical and physical access controls, the installation of badge readers is more directly related to physical access control. The decision about who gets access based on job roles might involve RBAC, but the implementation tool described (badge readers) falls under physical access control.

#### Data Plane (Forwarding Plane)

The data plane is responsible for the actual forwarding of packets based on the decisions made by the control plane. Actions within the data plane include:

- Forwarding packets based on the routing table (Layer 3)
- Switching frames based on the MAC address table (Layer 2)
- Applying Quality of Service (QoS) policies
- Filtering packets with Access Control Lists (ACLs)

#### Control Plane

The control plane is responsible for making decisions about how packets should be forwarded. Actions within the control plane include:

- Running routing protocols (OSPF, EIGRP, RIP, BGP) to build routing tables
- Responding to network control messages (e.g., ICMP, ARP)
- Managing network topology and state information
- Handling configuration and management tasks

**A. Compare the destination IP address to the IP routing table**

This action occurs within the data plane. When a router receives a packet, it compares the destination IP address of the packet to the entries in its IP routing table to determine the next-hop address and interface. This process is part of the packet forwarding mechanism.

FHRP protocols are designed to provide redundancy for the default gateway in a network, ensuring continuous network availability even if one of the gateways fails. This is crucial in maintaining a reliable and resilient network infrastructure. The primary FHRP protocols include:

- **HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)**
- **VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol)**
- **GLBP (Gateway Load Balancing Protocol)**

The question is asking about the type of 802.11 management frame that is used when a wireless client device moves (roams) between access points within the same SSID (Service Set Identifier), which is essentially the same wireless network.

When a client roams between access points (APs) within the same wireless network (SSID), it needs to inform the new AP of its presence and request to join the network. This is done using a **Reassociation Request** frame.
